Plagiarism can also\nbe hidden when text is translated from one language to another with no credit to the version, which is called\ncross- language plagiarism. Plagiarism is widely found in text, document’s, papers, codes, images. Plagiarism\ndetection systems find copies, not plagiarism and for translations or heavily edited material, the systems are\npowerless. We have proposed a new system by using web services for detecting different types of plagiarism,\nthis system able to detect synonyms, translations of words.\n\nKeywords: Intelligent Plagiarism, Literal Plagiarism, Semantic Analysis, Web Services\nI. INTRODUCTION\nPlagiarism can be defined as turning of someone else’s work as our own without reference to original source.\nPlagiarism is copying another person&#x27;s ideas, words or writing and pretending that they are one&#x27;s own work. It\ncan involve violating copyright laws. College students who are caught plagiarizing can be expelled from school,\nand writers who plagiarize will often be taken less seriously. Commonly in practice there are different\nplagiarisms methods like Copy – paste plagiarism (copying word to word textual information), Paraphrasing\n(copying same content in different words),Translated plagiarism (content translation and use without reference\nto original work), Artistic plagiarism (presenting same work using different media: text, images etc.), Idea\nplagiarism (using similar ideas which are not common knowledge), Code plagiarism (using program codes\nwithout permission or reference),No proper use of quotation marks (failing to identify exact parts of borrowed\ncontent),Misinformation of references (adding reference to incorrect or non existing source).\n\n1.1 Types of Plagiarism\n1.1.1 Literal Plagiarism\nLiteral plagiarism is a common and major practice wherein plagiarists do not spend much time in hiding the\nacademic crime they committed. For example, they simply copy and paste the text from the Internet. Aside from\nfew alterations in the original text, copy text word for word.\n\n336 | P a g e\n\nPlagiarism\n\nLiteral Plagiarism\n\nIntelligent Plagiarism\n\nFig. 1 Types of Plagiarism\n1.1.2 Intelligent Plagiarism\nIntelligent plagiarism is a serious academic dishonesty wherein plagiarists try to deceive readers by changing the\ncontributions of others to appear as their own. Intelligent plagiarists try to hide, obfuscate, and change the\noriginal work in various intelligent ways, including text manipulation, translation and idea adoption.\n1.1.2.1 Text Manipulation: Plagiarism can be obfuscated by manipulating the text and changing most of its\nappearance\n1.1.2.2 Translation: Obfuscation can also be done by translating the text from one language to another without\nproper referencing to the original source.\n1.1.2.3 Idea Adoption: Idea adoption is the most serious plagiarism that refers to the use of other’s ideas, such\nas results, contributions, findings, and conclusions, without citing the original source of ideas.\n\n1.2 Plagiarism Detection Methods\n1.2.1 Fingerprinting\nFingerprinting is currently the most widely applied approach to plagiarism detection. This method forms\nrepresentative digests of documents by selecting a set of multiple substrings (n-grams) from them.\n1.2.2 Citation analysis\nCitation-based plagiarism detection relies on citation analysis, and is the only approach to plagiarism detection\nthat does not rely on the textual similarity. It examines the citation and reference information in texts to identify\nsimilar patterns in the citation sequences. As such, this approach is suitable for scientific texts, or other\nacademic documents that contain citations.\n1.2.3 Stylometry\nStylometry subsumes statistical methods for quantifying an author’s unique writing style and is mainly used for\nauthorship attribution. By constructing and comparing Stylometry models for different text segments, passages\nthat are stylistically different from others, hence potentially plagiarized, can be detected.\n1.2.4 String Matching\nString matching is a prevalent approach used in computer science, compare original string with suspicious\ndocument to detect plagiarized string.\n1.2.5 Bag of words\nBag of words analysis represent the adoption of vector space retrieval, a traditional IR concept, to the domain of\nplagiarism detection. Documents are represented as one or multiple vectors, e.g. for different document parts,\n\n337 | P a g e\n\nwhich are used for pair wise similarity computations. Similarity computation may then rely on the\ntraditional cosine similarity measure, or on more sophisticated similarity measures.\n\n1.3 Parameters that Effect Plagiarism\n1.3.1 Synonyms: A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or\nphrase in the same language. For example, if we talk about a long time or an extended time, long and extended\nare synonymous with in that context.\n1.3.2 Active Passive: A sentence whose agent is marked as grammatical subject is called an active sentence. In\ncontrast, a sentence in which the subject has the role of patient or theme is named a passive sentence, and its\nverb is expressed in passive voice. E.g. (Harry ate six shrimp at dinner (active)) (At dinner, six shrimp were\neaten by Harry (passive)).\n1.3.3 Tense: In grammar, tense is a category that expresses time reference. Basic tenses found in many\nlanguages include the past, present and future, E.g. (The sun sets in the west) (All the cars stop at this crossing).\n\nII. RELATED WORK\nProtection of digital documents from illegal copy has received much attention recently. Most of techniques for\ncopy case detection are based on ideas of substring matching. In paper [3] string matching approach basically\nidentifies maximum matches in pairs of strings, which not possible for large amount of data. In paper [4] and\npaper [5] keyword similarity mechanism is used but fail give any method for semantic plagiarism detection.\n\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nThe user uploads the document to check the plagiarism in its document. The proposed system decomposed the\ndocument into single words. By web crawling process using web services, system performs the semantic\ncomparison and also compares the user document with web to check plagiarism in the user document. After the\ncomparison the user document result will be send to the user with highlighted link, it define source of data i.e.\nfrom where user document is copied. If no links are displayed then there is no plagiarism in user document.\n3.1 Algorithm\n1.\n\nUser uploads documents in proposed software to detect plagiarism.\n\n2.\n\nOn client machine decomposition of documents is performed.\n\n3.\n\nIn next phase software check the document semantically.\n\n4.\n\nPlagiarism Checker System performs searching using web services follows web crawling process.\n\n5.\n\nProposed System display results, if data is copied from any source gives hyperlinks and if not found then\ncontent is unique.\n\n338 | P a g e\n\nStart\n\nUser Input\n\nClient Machine\n\nSynonyms\nComparison\n\nWeb Server\n\nPlagiarism Checker\n(searching)\n\nWeb Crawling\n\nPlagiarism Checker\nResults\n\nStop\n\nFig. 2 Shows Algorithm of Proposed Method\nIV. RESULTS\nProposed System display plagiarism detection search results shown in figure 3, it is based on multi gram\napproach. It check plagiarism through web, no local database is created. It split the document into single word.\nProposed system gives the links of source from where data is copied. Through these formulas proposed system\nefficiency is calculated.\nSensitivity = No of links detected about plagiarized data/ Total no of Inputs\nSpecifity = No of links not detected about plagiarized data/ Total no of Inputs\n\n339 | P a g e\n\nTable 1 Shows the Output of System\nCategory of Input Text\n\nSensitivity\n\nSpecifity\n\nEfficiency\n\nThesis Files\n\n0.995\n\n0.005\n\n99.5\n\nCollege Assignments\n\n0.99\n\n0.01\n\n99.5\n\n0.990740741\n\n0.009259259\n\n99.07407407\n\nOthers\n\nFig. 3 Showing Links of plagiarized data by proposed system for document\nThe proposed method is compared with 100 thesis files, 105 college assignments and other source of data to\ndetect plagiarism. The efficiency of proposed method is shown in figure 4, 99% efficient results as compare to\nexisting system. It is a fast, accurate and efficient method for semantic plagiarism detection using web services.\n\nFig. 4 Shows the Efficiency of Proposed Method\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe proposed system works on semantic plagiarism detection using web services, detect plagiarized data fast\nand accurately as compare to existing system. It removes the limitation of existing system as they are based on\nstring matching and do not check semantic of words. It works on semantic technology.\n\n340 | P a g e\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n\nM.S.
