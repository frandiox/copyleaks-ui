This analysis served to provide an insight into the characteristics and capabilities for each of the detection algorithms before applying them to detect suspicious document similarities.\n\nA.1 Bibliographic Coupling We analyzed Bibliographic Coupling (BC), both the number (absolute Bibliographic Coupling strength, ‫ݏ‬஻஼ ) or fraction (relative Bibliographic Coupling strength, ‫ݎ‬஻஼ ) of references that two documents have in common for two reasons. First, we expected ‫ݏ‬஻஼ and ‫ݎ‬஻஼ to be valuable criteria for constraining the scope of the CbPD analysis to document pairs more likely to share a significant citation-based similarity. Additionally, such a reduction of collection size increases computing speed. Second, we wished to test the extent to which BC strength can point to suspicious document similarities. To investigate these two questions, we analyzed the distribution of bibliographically coupled document pairs in the PMC OAS.

To test the extent to which high BC strengths reflect highly uncommon citation-based document similarities, we chose to preliminarily analyze the approximately 3 % of document pairs with the highest ‫ݏ‬஻஼ . We performed the selection of the respective document pairs by stetting ‫ݏ‬஻஼ ൒ 4 as a minimum threshold for inclusion. This threshold retained 972,919 distinct document pairs (2.5 % of the bibliographically coupled document pairs) for analysis. Setting a required minimum ‫ݏ‬஻஼ potentially excluded documents containing few references. This is problematic, because even documents with few total references may have a substantial relative BC strength (‫ݎ‬஻஼ ). Having a large fraction of references in common represents a significant citation-based document similarity although ‫ݏ‬஻஼ = 4 may be undercut. Therefore, we also chose to include documents with ‫ݏ‬஻஼ &lt; 4 if ‫ݎ‬஻஼ is high. To determine the threshold above which ‫ݎ‬஻஼ should be uncommonly high, we analyzed the\n\n268\n\nAppendix\n\ndistribution of ‫ݎ‬஻஼ over all bibliographically coupled document pairs (see Figure 58). On average, the fraction of references a document has in common with another document (‫ݎ‬஻஼ ) makes up a minor share, ‫׽‬3 %, of a document’s overall references. We chose to select the ‫׽‬5 % of bibliographically coupled document pairs with the highest ‫ݎ‬஻஼ . To do so, we set ‫ݎ‬஻஼ = 9 % as a minimum threshold. In other words, we included document pairs with ‫ݏ‬஻஼ &lt; 4, if they had 9 % or more of their references in common. 90.000.000\n\n67.108.864\n\nRev. cum. freq. of documents\n\n80.000.000\n\n16.777.216 4.194.304\n\n70.000.000\n\n1.048.576\n\n60.000.000\n\n262.144 65.536\n\n50.000.000\n\n16.384\n\n40.000.000\n\n4.096 1.024\n\n30.000.000\n\n256\n\n20.000.000\n\n64 16\n\n10.000.000\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1 0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nFraction of shared references\n\nߤ = 3.08%\n\nߪ = 2.11%\n\nܲଶହ = 1.69%\n\nܲହ଴ = 2.38%\n\nܲ଻ହ = 3.70%\n\nFigure 58: Distribution of Relative Bibliographic Coupling Strength (rBC )\n\nIn addition to using Bibliographic Coupling to limit the scope of the analysis, we also wanted to evaluate its usefulness in detecting suspiciously similar, potentially plagiarized documents. Since we compare all documents against all others in a n:n comparison, the number of detected similarities requires finding a reasonable confinement of documents for manual inspection. To achieve this, we considered the following two criteria.\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n269\n\nFirst, we selected the top 10,000 document pairs with the highest ‫ݏ‬஻஼ . To rely not only on absolute counts, we consolidated these documents with the 10,000 document pairs that had the highest ‫ݎ‬஻஼ . In total, 13,911 document pairs fulfilled one or both criteria. We plotted the selected document pairs according to their absolute and relative BC strength as shown in the scatter plot in Figure 59. Selecting the top 10,000 documents for both criteria causes the clear breakup in the data points in both dimensions of the plot. ‫ݏ‬஻஼ ൒ 25 ᦬ ‫ݎ‬௦ ൒ 65 %\n\n100\n\nFraction of shared references rS in %\n\n90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10\n\n‫ݏ‬஻஼ ൒ 55\n\n0 1\n\n4\n\n16\n\n64\n\n256\n\nBibliographic Coupling strength sBC\n\nFigure 59: Document Pairs with High Absolute and Relative BC Strength\n\nExamining the left upper plot area, we can conclude that in an n:n detection scenario, an isolated examination of ‫ݎ‬஻஼ is not a valuable similarity indicator for ‫ݏ‬஻஼ ‫ د‬20. For almost any ‫ݏ‬஻஼ ‫ د‬20 a substantial number of documents exist that share between 60 % and 80 % of their references with other documents. For ‫ݏ‬஻஼ ൑ 8, even 100 % shared references are common. Samples indicated that documents with ‫ݏ‬஻஼ ൑ 8, but a large ‫ݎ‬஻஼ are typically very short. These short documents have most of their references in common with much longer\n\n270\n\nAppendix\n\ndocuments. The scatter plot suggests that in the given n:n detection scenario, high thresholds must be set for ‫ݏ‬஻஼ and ‫ݎ‬஻஼ to limit the document space to a number that allows manual inspection. We defined three heuristic criteria to select and examine the most similar documents, i.e. the documents lying to the upper right of the thresholds, indicated by straight lines in Figure 59. We chose document pairs with ‫ݏ‬஻஼ ൒ 55 and consolidated them with documents with lower absolute BC strengths (‫ݏ‬஻஼ ൒ 25), but higher relative BC strengths ‫ݎ‬஻஼ ൒ 65. 322 document pairs matched the selection criteria and were analyzed. We differentiated between bibliographically coupled documents with authors in common (277 document pairs) and no authors in common (45 document pairs) to identify potential plagiarism as opposed to duplicate publications. We examined 10 document pairs that had no authors in common and 30 document pairs with authors in common. The examined samples showed that strongly coupled documents with authors in common typically fall into these categories:\n\nIdentical text published in different journals, e.g., [192] and [193], [196] and [197], or [7] and [8]\n\n\nDuplicates, i.e. the same journal article appeared in PMC multiple times, e.g., [289] and [290], [287] and [288], or [61] and [62]\n\n\nErrata including a complete new version of a previously published text, e.g., [326] and [327], or [341] and [342]\n\n\nUpdates on prior research using many of the same references, e.g., [180] and [179], [278] and [308], or [211] and [210]\n\nErrata and multiple copies, which are likely erroneous submissions of the same text to PMC®, are clearly unsuspicious. The appropriateness of simultaneous publication of the same article in different journals is casedependent. Duplicate publication can be justified if the goal is reaching a broader audience or increasing the dissemination of key findings. If the publication mainly serves interests of the author without contributing to the scientific community and without acknowledging prior publications in other venues,\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n271\n\nduplicate publication represents undue behavior. As far as we can judge, the listed examples of updates seem to provide new information, and hence are legitimate examples of highly similar texts. Most examined documents that shared no common authors were review articles on related or identical topics that shared a significant number of references. We found no blatant copy &amp; paste plagiarism. Bibliographic Coupling does not provide clues as to which of these documents might contain suspiciously similar content. Overall, Bibliographic Coupling provides a rough measure of document similarity in the given n:n detection setting, in which we regard all documents as potentially suspicious and compare them against all others. Bibliographic Coupling can identify identical and highly related documents that contain a large number of common references. We assume that ‫ݏ‬஻஼ and ‫ݎ‬஻஼ can be more valuable for indicating suspicious document similarities in a 1:n detection scenario, in which one potentially suspicious document is compared against a genuine reference collection. To substantiate this assumption, we analyzed the distribution of documents with ‫ݎ‬஻஼ ൒ 9 %, which we set as a threshold for suspicion, depending on the number of documents the respective fraction of references is shared with (see Figure 60).\n\n272\n\nAppendix\n\nRev. cum. frequency of documents\n\n160.000 140.000 120.000 100.000 80.000 60.000 40.000 20.000 0 1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n16\n\n32\n\n64\n\n262144 131072 65536 32768 16384 8192 4096 2048 1024 512 256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192\n\nEƵŵďĞƌ\u0003ŽĨ\u0003ĚŽĐ͘\u0003ǁŝƚŚ\u0003ǁŚŝĐŚ\u0003ŝŶĚŝǀ͘\u0003ĚŽĐ͘\u0003ƐŚĂƌĞ\u0003dž\u0003ш\u0003ε\u0003й\u0003ŽĨ\u0003ƚŚĞŝƌ\u0003ƌĞĨĞƌĞŶĐĞƐ\n\nߤ = 19.85 ߪ = 112.03\n\nܲଶହ = 1\n\nܲହ଴ =4\n\nܲ଻ହ =12\n\nFigure 60: Distribution of Documents Sharing ‫ ݎ‬൒ 9 % of References\n\nThe median of the distribution is four; the upper quartile is 12. This means that 50 % of all ‫׽‬168,000 bibliographically coupled documents share 9 % or more of their references with a maximum of four other documents and 75 % do so with a maximum of 12 documents. We find it realistic to assume that examiners would be willing and able to manually check four to 12 documents when told that the amount of reference overlap is uncommon and may point to suspicious similarity. Thus, we assume that in a majority of cases in a 1:n detection setting, ‫ݎ‬஻஼ is a valuable criterion to identify potentially similar documents in preparation for a manual inspection. Similarly, the number of documents for which an &quot;unusually&quot; high ‫ݏ‬஻஼ exists is a more restrictive and thus a more valuable selector in a 1:n detection setting. As previously mentioned, we derived ‫ݏ‬஻஼ = 4 as the threshold for potential suspicion. Figure 61 shows the distribution of documents that are bibliographically coupled to other documents with ‫ݏ‬஻஼ ൒ 4. The median is 3, the upper quartile 10. In other words, 75 % of bibliographically coupled documents\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n273\n\nare &quot;strongly&quot; coupled to a maximum of 10 other documents.

The LCCS measures global document similarity in the form of a single value. To test the detection capabilities of the LCCS approach and to understand the influence of continuity and rarity of matching citations in terms of the CF-Score and Cont.-Score, we used both scores as the dimensions of a scatter plot. CF-Score and Cont.-Score both depend on the pattern length, i.e. the number of matching citations, which makes them additive scores. Documents that differ from the majority of documents with comparable numbers of matching citations\n\n274\n\nAppendix\n\nrepresent notable outliers in one or both dimensions. To prevent scores of documents with many references from masking outliers obtained from shorter documents, separately analyzing documents with similar numbers of references is a reasonable approach. For the evaluation presented here, however, we did not perform this separation, but considered documents with the highest CF-Scores and Cont.-Scores, regardless of their number of references. To limit the scope of analysis for evaluating the Longest Common Citation Sequence, we used a graph-based approach similar to the one employed in the case of Bibliographic Coupling. We selected the 10,000 document pairs with the highest cumulative CF-Scores calculated for citations that are part of the LCCS. We consolidated these document pairs with the 10,000 document pairs scoring highest when considering the maximum of the LCCS length and the associated Cont.-Score. 15,392 distinct document pairs matched the selection criteria. Figure 62 plots these pairs according to the dimensions CF-Score and the maximum of either pattern length or Cont.-Score. Using the scatter plot, we chose thresholds for both dimensions that separated the most dominant outliers. We selected document pairs with CF-Score ൒ 480 and/or a maximum length or Cont.-Score ൒ 310. We excluded document pairs already examined as part of the Bibliographic Coupling analysis. We retained six document pairs with authors in common and 49 document pairs with no authors in common.\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n275\n\n2000 1800 1600\n\nCF-Score\n\n1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 1\n\n4\n\n16\n\n64\n\n256\n\n1024\n\n4096\n\n16384\n\nMax (length, Cont.-Score)\n\nFigure 62: Document Pairs with High Similarity Scores in the LCCS Assessment\n\nExamining a sample of 15 document pairs from the group with authors in common yielded:\n\nSix duplicate submissions of the respective journal to PMC.\n\n\nSix updates on prior research. The updates featured Longest Common Citation Sequence scores of 286, 283, 198, 135, 91 and 88 citations. However, as far as we were able to judge the articles, they presented new findings.\n\n\nThree document pairs appeared to be slightly reworded reports on identical literature reviews submitted to different journals. The three documents pairs [76] and [75], [241] and [240], [90] and [162] respectively featured longest common citation sequences of 218, 178 and 129, a majority of sequences in direct succession (without gaps of non-matching citations). Two pairs were submitted to the respective journals within one month, and another\n\n276\n\nAppendix\n\npair within three months. None of the later documents indicated a relation to the earlier published documents. The appropriateness of such publications must be judged in context and by expert examiners. Among the six document pairs with no common authors, one document pair was an annually updated medical standard, which mentioned no authors and had a LCCS of 364. The remaining five document pairs had LCCS lengths ranging from 26 to 48. The articles were related, but did not show indications of plagiarism. To analyze how the number of shared references influences LCCS-based similarity, we examined the relation of absolute Bibliographic Coupling strength to LCCS length. We selected the 10,000 document pairs with the highest LCCS and consolidated them with the 10,000 document pairs with the highest ‫ݏ‬஻஼ . We omitted documents we had checked as part of prior analysis and created a scatter plot with the dimensions absolute Bibliographic Coupling strength and LCCS length (see Figure 63). By visually examining the most prominent outliers, we defined heuristic thresholds for including document pairs in a manual check. We selected document pairs if their LCCS had a length of ݈ &gt; 64. We also included document pairs with shorter LCCS (݈ &gt; 39) if their absolute Bibliographic Coupling strength was comparably low (‫ݏ‬஻஼ &lt; 16). 96 documents matched the selection criteria, of which 18 had no authors in common, while 68 had authors in common.\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n277\n\nFigure 63: LCCS Length Dependent on Bibliographic Coupling Strength\n\nThe results from checking documents with authors in common were in line with earlier findings. LCCS lengths ranged from 40 to 108. Among the highestscoring document pairs, we identified one duplicate submission to PMC, which was probably erroneous. Furthermore, we found one identical text published in two journals [206] and [205]. The duplicate publication appeared to be sanctioned because it presented a standardized reporting scheme. We also found similar, yet non-identical, reviews published in different journals, e.g., [10] and [9]. The two articles had a LCCS of length ݈ = 91 in this class of articles. Of the 18 article pairs with no authors in common, eight were review articles (see for example [159] and [182]). The pattern of highly related periodic review articles was dominant. The remaining article pairs were highly related research papers in very specific areas of research. One example of such a document pair is [242] and [115], which both discuss nucleotide distributions in the DNA of specific cell cultures and have a LCCS of 50. We did not find indications for plagiarism in these articles.\n\n278\n\nAppendix\n\nWe conclude that analyzing the LCCS is a reliable approach for limiting the retrieval space of potential candidate documents, especially in cases where domain experts perform a 1:n analysis. Further research into the correlations between Bibliographic Coupling strength and Longest Common Citation Sequences seems beneficial before setting a specific suspiciousness threshold for the number of references in common. Once established, such thresholds are a strong similarity indicator, especially in a 1:n detection scenario. Both Bibliographic Coupling and the LCCS yielded recurring patterns for articles with authors in common. Such articles tended to be highly related updates on prior research or publications of identical or similar texts in different journals. Both approaches are able to identify high levels of global document similarity accurately, especially in a 1:n detection scenario. In our subsequent investigations, we focused on local document similarity and considered only documents sharing no common authors.\n\nA.3 Greedy Citation Tiling Greedy Citation Tiling (GCT) , as described in Section 4.4.3, identifies all longest substrings of matching citations, so-called citation tiles, within the citation sequences of two documents. Citation tiles are composed solely of matching citations in identical order. To gain an understanding of the document similarities that lead to high scores in a GCT analysis, we reduced the number of documents to the ones most similar. To achieve this reduction, we analyzed the distribution of citation tile lengths in order to set a suitable threshold. Given the distribution (see Figure 64), we disregarded all documents that did not contain at least one citation tile of length three. We also wished to estimate the selective power of the chosen similarity threshold in a 1:n detection setting. For this purpose, we analyzed the distribution of documents sharing citation tiles of length three or more with other documents depending on the number of documents the tiles were shared with (see Figure 65). The upper quartile of the distribution is two. In other words, 75 % of documents that share a citation tile of length three or more do so with a maximum of two other documents. Therefore, we assume that citation tiles of\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n279\n\n4.194.304\n\nNumber of document pairs\n\n1.048.576 262.144 65.536 16.384 4.096 1.024 256 64 16 4 1 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50\n\nMaximum tile length in document\n\nߤ = 1.23 ߪ = 0.55\n\nܲଶହ = 1\n\nܲହ଴ =1\n\nܲ଻ହ =1\n\nRev. cum. freq. of doc. contaiing citation tiles with length lш\u00033\n\nFigure 64: Distribution of Maximum Citation Tile Lengths 30.000 25.000 20.000 15.000 10.000 5.000 0 1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n16\n\n32\n\nNo. of documents sharing a citation tile of length l ш\u00033\n\nߤ = 2.39 ߪ = 3.69\n\nܲଶହ = 1\n\nܲହ଴ =1\n\nܲ଻ହ =2\n\nFigure 65: Distribution of Documents with Citation Tiles of Length ݈ ൒ 3\n\n64\n\n280\n\nAppendix\n\nlength three or more might be a good indicator of potentially suspicious document similarity in a 1:n detection setting.\n\nSum of CF-Scores for tiles in a document\n\n4.096 2.048\n\n‫ܨܥ‬оܵܿ‫ ݁ݎ݋‬൒ 815\n\n1.024 512 256 128 64 32 16 8\n\n݈ ൒ 40\n\n4 2 1 1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n16\n\n32\n\n64\n\n128\n\n256\n\n512\n\n6XP\u0003RI\u0003WLOH\u0003OHQJWKV\u000f\u0003O\u000f\u0003IRU\u0003WLOHV\u0003ZLWK\u0003O\u0014\n\nFigure 66: Document Pairs with Highest Similarity Scores in GCT Assessment\n\nTo select the most suspicious documents for manual inspection, we followed a similar scatter plot approach as in the case of the other approaches analyzed earlier. We plotted the sum of citation tile lengths and the cumulative CF-Score for all tiles in the 10,000 documents that contained at least one tile of length three and scored highest in either of the two dimensions (see Figure 66). To avoid intrinsically replicating a de-facto Bibliographic Coupling assessment, we only included tiles with a length of ݈ &gt; 1 in the cumulated length score. As reported earlier, the average tile length is 1.23 (see Figure 64), thus excluding tiles with ݈ ൑ 1 from the cumulated length score increases the selective power of the score. Using heuristic visual outlier detection, we set a summed CF-Score ൒ 815 and/or a summed tile length ݈ ൒ 40 as thresholds. After removing previously analyzed documents, 153 distinct documents remained, of which eight document pairs had no authors in common.\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n281\n\nSix of these article pairs were reviews, one article pair was a periodically republished medical standard and another was a related research paper. All articles listed consecutive prior studies. The following table shows a typical example of a text excerpt with long citation tiles taken from two review articles written by different authors. The publishing dates of both articles are apart by ‫׽‬4 years. The references 111 to 119 in [121] and 64 to 72 in [343] refer to the same sources in identical order. We were able to identify similar examples using the LCCS and to a lesser extent using Bibliographic Coupling.\n\n282\n\nAppendix Table 25: In-text Citation Tile (Example 1) Text excerpt from [121]\n\nText excerpt from [343]\n\n“Following entry to the brain, monocytes, lymphocytes, activated macrophage, microglia and astrocytes release cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and other neurotoxins that disrupt normal cellular functioning, modify neurotransmitter action, and may lead to leukoencephalopathy and ultimately neuronal apoptosis [111,112]. Some of these neurotoxins include TNF-α, arachidonic acid, platelet activating factors (PAF), nitric oxide (NO), and quinolinic acid (QUIN). NO is synthesized by endothelial cells, macrophages and neurons and might be associated with the NMDA type glutamate associated neurotoxicity. A high level of inducible NO synthase has been found in the brain of HAD patients [113]. In HIV-1 patients who also are/were drug addicted (e.g. cocaine, heroine), a 40-fold increase in expression of NO synthase in neurons of temporal lobes was reported [114]. TNF-α is released by HIV-1 infected macrophage microglia and particularly affects oligodendrocytes [115]. It has been shown that TNF-α mRNA level in the subcortical regions of HAD patients&#x27; CNS are higher than in AIDS patients without neurological symptoms [116]. In addition, TNF-α can damage the BBB,\n\n“This may cause alterations in neurotransmitter action and causes leukoencephalopathy resulting in neuronal apoptosis.[64,65] TNF-α, platelet activating factor (PAF), nitric oxide (NO), and quinolinic acid (QUIN) also behave like neurotoxicant and cause neurotoxicity. NO is produced by microvascular endothelial cells, macrophages, and neurons which may result in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate-associated neurotoxicity.

We randomly selected the following two text excerpts from article pairs that shared exactly one citation tile of length three (and potentially additional citations, but for the given selection, no other matching pattern was allowed to be longer than two).\n\n284\n\nAppendix Table 26: In-text Citation Tile (Example 2) Text excerpt from ([138], p.1)\n\nText excerpt from ([37], p. 90)\n\n“In RA, RF is detected in 70-80 % of patients with established disease, and is an integral part of the definition of this disorder.

Slack et al. calculated sensitivities of 12 and 16 for two different filaggrin preparations, while only one of five positive sera reacted with both preparations [49].

The articles are clearly not a plagiarism, but are semantically highly related. The article [37] shares a citation tile of length three only with the article [138]. The article [138] shares citation tiles of length three with two other documents.\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n285\n\nTable 27: In-text Citation Tile (Example 3) Text excerpt from ([372], p. 216)\n\nText excerpt from ([47], p. 73)\n\n“In RA, RF is detected in 70–80 % of patients with established disease, and is an integral part of the definition of this disorder.

Increased production of TGF β1 is observed in epidermal [35], gastric [36], renal [37], breast [38 41], and prostate carcinomas [42] when compared with normal tissues.”\n\n“There is considerable evidence to suggest that, at late stages in tumorigenesis, TGF βs can actually promote the tumorigenic process, particularly if the epithelial cells have lost responsiveness to the growth regulatory effects of TGF β by this time [9,39,40,41]. Thus, advanced human tumors show increased levels of TGF β expression [42,43,44], and TGF βs are known to suppress the immunosurveillance system, to enhance angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, and to increase drug resistance [45,46,47,48].”\n\nIn [372] and [47] the citations 39 to 41 and 42 to 44 represent references to identical sources in matching order. Aside from the tile of length three, the documents share two other single citations. None of the documents shares a tile of length three or more with any other articles. The paragraphs of both articles describe the effect of a tumor growth factor in early and later stages of cancer. Both articles are not a plagiarism, but the relatedness of the paragraph is evident. These examples show that citation tiles of length three or more are highly predictive indicators for legitimate or potentially illegitimate local content similarity. Identifying legitimate, yet highly similar text segments can, for example, be used to improve academic literature recommender systems. Thus,\n\n286\n\nAppendix\n\nthe GCT approach can be valuable to improve general information retrieval and particular plagiarism detection systems. As the empirical examples show, GCT can identify highly related text segments that differ significantly in wording. However, due to its exact matching approach, GCT fails when shared citations are scaled or their order is transposed.\n\nA.4 Citation Chunking For a first test of Citation Chunking (Cit-Chunk), we evaluated the variation of Citation Chunking that splits up both documents into chunks and includes citations in chunks dependent on the previous shared citations (see Section 4.4.4 for details). The algorithm adds a shared citation to a chunk if n non-matching citations, where ݊ ൑ 1 or 1 &gt; ݊ ൑ ‫ݏ‬, separate it from the last preceding matching citation. The variable s equals the number of citations in the chunk under construction. Once the algorithm has chunked both documents, it compares each chunk of one document to each chunk of the other document regardless of the order of citations. As in the case of the other similarity measures in our experiments, we had to limit the large number of documents with matching citation chunks to allow for a more detailed analysis. To define a suitable exclusion threshold for documents, we analyzed the distribution of maximum chunk lengths (see Figure 67).\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n287\n\n1.048.576\n\nNumber of document pairs\n\n262.144 65.536 16.384 4.096 1.024 256 64 16 4 1 1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n16\n\n32\n\n64\n\n128\n\n256\n\n512\n\n1024\n\nMaximum chunk length in document\n\nߤ = 2.08 ߪ = 3.20\n\nܲଶହ = 1\n\nܲହ଴ =1\n\nܲ଻ହ = 2\n\nFigure 67: Distribution of Maximum Chunk Lengths\n\nThe distribution shows that Citation Chunking, on average, yielded longer maximum patterns than Greedy Citation Tiling (see the distribution of maximum citation tile lengths in Figure 64, page 279, for a comparison). In addition, the number of document pairs that shared a maximum pattern of specified length decreased more slowly in the case of Citation Chunking than in the case of GCT. Furthermore, the overall number of identified citation chunks, ‫׽‬3.5 million, was lower than the number of identified citation tiles, ‫׽‬12.4 million. These characteristics indicate that Citation Chunking includes more matching citations into patterns than the GCT approach, which represents the expected behavior. The results also support the assumption that the number of text segments containing matching citations in close proximity, yet not necessarily in the same order, is significantly higher than that of text segments with perfectly matching citation tiles. Figure 67 shows that the number of documents with long citation chunks was significantly higher than the number of documents with long citation tiles, which\n\n288\n\nAppendix\n\nindicates a negative characteristic of Citation Chunking. The tested chunking algorithm allows an increasing number of non-matching citations to be included in the pattern if a higher number of matching citations is already included in the chunk under construction. This characteristic negatively affects documents that share many references and citations, because in such a case the chunking algorithm tends to form a small number of very long chunks. Approximately 10 million document pairs in the PMC OAS shared ‫ ݎ‬൒ 64 references, refer to Bibliographic Coupling in A.1. Thus, the effect likely afflicts a large portion of the corpus. The effect was especially strong for review articles, because they often share up to several hundred references with other articles. Given the distribution of documents in Figure 67, we excluded document pairs from the assessment that did not share at least one citation chunk of length four or greater. This limited the number of documents to approximately 143,000. We also examined the usefulness of this threshold in regard to an &quot;average case&quot; 1:n detection scenario. For this purpose, we analyzed the distribution of documents sharing citation chunks of length ݈ ൒ 4 depending on the number of documents that shared the respective patterns. Figure 68 shows the corresponding plot, which indicates that a citation chunk of length four is not as selective as a citation tile of length three (compare this to the distribution of citation tiles in Figure 65, page 279).\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n289\n\nRev. cum. freq. of doc. containing citation chunks of length lш4\n\n80.000 70.000 60.000 50.000 40.000 30.000 20.000 10.000 0 1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n16\n\n32\n\n64\n\n128\n\n256\n\nNo. of doc. a citation chunk of length lш4 is shared with\n\nߤ = 4.95 ߪ = 9.32\n\nܲଶହ = 1\n\nܲହ଴ =2\n\nܲ଻ହ =5\n\nFigure 68: Distribution of Documents sharing a Cit. Chunk Length of l &gt;= 4\n\nNonetheless, setting the minimum chunk length to four caused the upper quartile of the distribution in Figure 68 to equal five. Thus, 75 % of documents in the corpus that shared citation chunks of length four or more did so with a maximum of five other documents. To further confine the sub-collection to be analyzed, we employed a similar graph-based approach as for the other similarity measures. We used the sum of CF-Scores and the maximum of the Cont.-Score or chunk length as the dimensions of a scatter plot. To avoid replicating a de-facto Bibliographic Coupling analysis (the majority of citation chunks have a length of one) we only considered the Cont.-Score or the length of chunks with length ݈ &gt; 1 for inclusion in the graph. We selected the 10,000 documents that met the selection criteria and featured the highest scores in either of the two dimensions. Figure 69 shows the resulting scatter plot.\n\n290\n\nAppendix\n\nFigure 69: Document Pairs Yielding High Similarity Scores Using Cit-Chunk\n\nConsistent with the evaluations of the similarity functions presented earlier, we visually selected outliers as indicated in Figure 69. The analysis of maximum chunk length had already indicated that Citation Chunking is prone to degenerate into a de-facto global similarity measure for documents sharing many references. Manually inspecting the highest scoring documents verified this expected result. A total of 128 document pairs matched the selection criteria, of which 47 had no authors in common. The large majority of these documents were review articles, which we already covered in the description of prior similarity functions. While Citation Chunking is able to identify such highly related documents, the measure did not provide a significant benefit over the LCCS approach. For documents with many shared references, citation chunks tend to become so large that a majority of a document’s citations are included in a chunk. For instance, the highest scoring document in the assessment yielded a citation chunk length of 139. We assume that such high similarities would also be detected using the Bibliographic Coupling or LCCS approach.\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n291\n\nThe strength of Citation Chunking lies in its ability to pinpoint specific local similarities. To illustrate this capacity, we analyzed the portion of selected documents with the shortest lengths (l &lt; 16 as indicated in Figure 69), but a high CF-Score. Consider the following example from the group of documents with shorter citation chunks, but a high CF-Score. The two documents [141] and [345] share a single citation chunk of length four, consisting of four citations of two distinct references that are repeated to outline various facts. Because the matching citations are transposed, we state alphanumeric keys formed of first author name and publication year in bold type in addition to the original numeric citations given in the texts. The two texts were not cases of plagiarism, but clearly related. As mentioned previously, the average specificity of citation chunks is not as high as that of citation tiles. For instance, the article [141] shared citation chunks of length four or more with eight additional documents, while the article [345] shared citations with the indicated document only.\n\n292\n\nAppendix Table 28: In-text Citation Chunk Example Text excerpt from ([141], p. 228)\n\n“[...] recent findings that challenge the dogma that metastases arise from a relatively small population of cells within a tumor that have a particularly high metastatic potential. Rather, microarray studies comparing metastatic and non-metastatic adenocarcinomas identified a molecular signature correlating with metastasis, and suggested that the bulk of cells within the tumor share this signature, and thus the metastatic potential is encoded within the bulk of the primary tumor [13 |Ramaswarmy03|]. This signature, defined as 17 differentially regulated genes, correlated with metastatic potential in solid tumors from a variety of organs, supporting the concept of a common pathway towards metastasis,\n\nText excerpt from ([345], p. 1) “According to the traditional model of metastasis, the potential to metastasize resides in a small subset of tumor cells that have acquired this property through a set of mutations that occur during the later stages of tumor progression [11]. An emerging concept has recently challenged this existing model of metastasis by demonstrating that the potential to metastasize is encoded in the bulk of the tumor and is present early in tumor pathogenesis [11, 12 |van’tVeer02| 13 |Ramaswarmy03|, 14].”\n\nand suggesting the existence of common therapeutic targets in different cancers. Gene-expression profiling has also been reported to be useful for predicting the clinical outcome of breast cancer [14 |van’tVeer02|]”.\n\nIn summary, we found that a chunk length of three to four is sufficient in most cases to predict local text similarity with high accuracy. Citation Chunking is most valuable for texts that share smaller or average numbers of citations. The\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n293\n\napproach is also capable of highlighting highly related texts with numerous citations in very close proximity, which is common in review articles. However, if documents share many references overall, the algorithm begins to lose its most valuable feature of highlighting the specific areas of highest similarity. The algorithm treats citation chunks like a bucket. Once this bucket gets too large, and potentially contains many non-matching citations, a manual analysis becomes cumbersome.\n\nA.5 Character-based PDS Sherlock To compare the CbPD detection performance to a character-based PDS, we also analyzed parts of the PMC OAS with the plagiarism detector Sherlock developed at the University of Sydney [184]. We chose Sherlock as a baseline approach for the following reasons:\n\nSherlock offers a fingerprinting detection approach, which is representative for most currently available PDS. Sherlock employs word-based text chunking and a probabilistic selection strategy for computing each document’s fingerprint.\n\n\nSherlock allows customizing the length of chunks and the probability of retaining chunks during the selection step. By default, Sherlock partitions the input texts into chunks of three words, selects on average one out of 16 chunks formed and discards the rest. For our experiment, we increased the probability of retaining chunks to one out of eight on average to perform a finer-grained comparison. Sherlock reports the document similarities identified as a percentage calculated as: ‫= ݉݅ݏ‬\n\nଵ଴଴௟ೞ ௟ವభ ା ௟ವమ ି ௟ೞ\n\nwhere ݈௦ is the length of passages\n\nidentified as similar in both documents and ݈஽ଵ and ݈஽ଶ denote the overall length of the two documents.\n\nSherlock is a lightweight open source C program, which we could easily adapt to the requirements of the evaluation. While most other available PDS are closed source or limit the number of analyzable\n\n294\n\nAppendix\n\ndocuments, Sherlock does not enforce a limit on analyzable documents. The required computational effort prohibited the use of Sherlock to analyze the entire test collection derived from the PMC OAS (185,170 documents) in an n:n\n\nanalysis\n\n(17,143,871,865\n\ncomparisons).\n\nRefer\n\nto\n\nComparison of Computational Efficiency, page 176, for more details.\n\nA.6 Character-based PDS Encoplot To compare the detection performance of CbPD to more than one character-based PDS, we additionally analyzed documents from the PMC OAS with Encoplot, a PDS developed by Grozea et al. [143]. We chose Encoplot as a baseline approach for the following reasons:\n\nThe system is a state-of-the-art research prototype. Encoplot won the PAN comparison of PDS in 2009 and constantly ranged among the best-performing PDS in subsequent PAN comparisons [260, 261, 264].\n\n\nEncoplot employs elaborate n-gram string matching for an n:n comparison of documents, i.e. the system compares each document to every other document in the collection. During each comparison of a document pair, the system matches all unique character n-gram pairs in the two documents. This approach guarantees high detection accuracy for literal text matches. The system extracts all character ngrams of length 16 from two documents under comparison into two separate lists, sorts the lists of n-grams, and uses a modified merge sort algorithm to identify matching n-grams. A limitation of Encoplot’s detection algorithm is that it matches the first occurrence of an n-gram in one document to the first occurrence of that n-gram in the second document, the second occurrence to the second and so on. If the number of n-gram occurrences in the documents is different, Encoplot does not identify all possible matches. For example, if Document 1 contains the n-gram &quot;abc&quot; twice and Document 2\n\nA Preliminary PMC OAS Corpus Analysis\n\n295\n\ncontains &quot;abc&quot; four times, Encoplot only matches the first two occurrences of “abc” in Document 2 to the two occurrences of &quot;abc&quot; in Document 1.\n\nEncoplot is optimized for speed and offers a worst case performance of O(n).\n\nDespite Encoplot’s efficiency, an n:n comparison of the 185,170 documents in the PMC OAS test collection would still require 17,143,871,865 comparisons, as in the case of Sherlock. The processing time required by Encoplot to perform these comparisons is just as infeasible as an n:n comparison using Sherlock. Refer to Comparison of Computational Efficiency, page 176, for details.\n\nB\n\nTechnical Details of the CitePlag Prototype\n\nSection B.1 describes the implementation of the sentence-word-tagger and Section B.2 describes the data parser, two subcomponents of the CitePlag prototype. Section B.3 presents the procedure for the consolidation of reference identifiers in the PMC OAS.\n\nB.1 Sentence-Word-Tagger (SW-Tagger) The SW-Tagger identifies individual sentences and words in NXML texts and marks them with delimiters that do not impair the validity of the original XML markup. Identifying parts of speech (POS) is a common task in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The ambiguity of natural language makes accurately identifying POS challenging. One example of a highly ambiguous grapheme in natural language is the period. Aside from indicating the conclusion of a sentence, a period can also be a decimal point, or a delimiter within an email address. The peculiarities of life science texts pose additional challenges to POS identification and force researchers to adjust POS taggers specifically for this field to achieve good POS detection performance. Articles in the life sciences frequently refer to chemical substances, abbreviations, or other domain-specific entities that are difficult to match to ordinary sentence structures. Due to the challenges of identifying POS in life science texts, we incorporated an existing POS tagger into the CitePlag document parser to detect sentence boundaries. Existing and potentially suitable POS taggers for the life sciences include OpenNLP, dTagger, SPToolkit and Stanford Core NLP [52, 91, 256, 314]. We evaluated OpenNLP [14] in combination with the extensions for POS tagging in life sciences proposed by Buyko et al. [52], Stanford CoreNLP [314], and SPToolkit [256] on their suitability for integration into the CitePlag document parser. For each of the three tools, we manually inspected five annotated documents. Although the test was too small to be statistically significant, the results of all tools were in line with results reported in earlier studies [52, 256].\n\nB Technical Details of the CitePlag Prototype\n\n297\n\nAll three tools achieved precision and recall values of ‫׽‬99 % for word and sentence boundary detection. In terms of processing time per document, SPToolkit, which required ‫׽‬30ms, was superior to OpenNLP and Stanford CoreNLP, which both required ‫׽‬1.5s. We attribute this difference in runtime to the complexity of the different detection approaches the systems employ. SPToolkit relies on comparably less complicated heuristic rule sets, while OpenNLP and Stanford CoreNLP use sophisticated machine-learning procedures. Another advantage of SPToolkit over OpenNLP and Stanford CoreNLP is that the output format of SPToolkit’s sentence detector is easier to integrate with the other sub-components of the document parser than that of OpenNLP or Stanford CoreNLP. SPToolkit provides its output as a plain Java string object that is universally usable. OpenNLP or Stanford CoreNLP discard the original XML markup and create individually formatted output files. This tagging behavior would require changes to the tools’ source codes to produce an output that includes sentence and word markup in addition to the original XML tags. Given the test results, we incorporated SPToolkit into the CitePlag document parser. All three of the tools tested showed nearly identical precision and recall in sentence detection, yet SPToolkit offered both better runtime performance and a favorable output format. By default, SPToolkit is not able to process XML texts. Therefore, the SW-Tagger substitutes all XML tags in the original documents with unique placeholder strings of the form Z\\*§running no./§ and stores the tag content in an index for later reinsertion. After the substitution, the SW-Tagger runs the sentence detection procedures of SPToolkit. SPToolkit does not feature word boundary detection. To avoid using a runtime-intensive POS tagger based on machine learning, we adapted and incorporated word markup heuristics commonly found in similar POS tools into the SW-Tagger. The SW-Tagger marks up word boundaries with plain text annotations similar to the ones employed for tagging sentences. These annotations do not interfere with the original XML markup. The SW-Tagger restores the original markup after the detection of sentences and words by re \f298\n\nAppendix\n\nsubstituting the inserted placeholder strings with the original tag content from the stored index. The algorithm uses regular expressions in JavaTM and was designed for use after a separate tagger, in our case SentParDetector [256], has identified sentence boundaries. The output of the sentence tagger has to list each sentence in a separate line and mark the beginning of a sentence with a specific character sequence. In the given case, the SW-Tagger replaces the XML style markups produced by SentParDetector and all original XML markups with the following character sequences prior to the word boundary detection: *§S/§ denotes the beginning of a sentence. _Z*§000/§ denotes an individual XML tag, which the SW-Tagger replaced with this placeholder string. The numbering 000 corresponds to an individual unique ascending number for each tag in the document. This way, the SWTagger can reinsert the original tags after the sentence and word markup process to retain the original document structure information. The SW-Tagger uses the following regular expression, which includes alternative tests for two main patterns. We list the entire expression in multiple sub-expressions to comment on the sub-patterns these sub-expressions match. The first main pattern, which the regular expression searches for, represents words separated by one or multiple whitespaces. To identify such patterns, the SW-Tagger uses the following sub-expression to search for the last alphanumeric character in a character sequence that is not part of a markup substitution mentioned above: “(?:(?:[a-zA-Z0-9](?!\\\\w|/§|([\\\\.,]?[0-9]+?)))”+ Note that the SW-Tagger treats numeric expressions or abbreviations as words. While we consider this behavior reasonable for CbPD, it might not be desirable for other applications. The following sub-expression allows any non-alphanumeric character, except for white spaces or characters that are part of a markup substitution, to follow the first sub-pattern of pattern 1.\n\nB Technical Details of the CitePlag Prototype\n\n299\n\n“(?:[^\\\\w\\\\s]|(?:[S0-9]+(?=/§)))*”+ This sub-expression causes the SW-Tagger to ignore, e.g., punctuation marks or brackets between words. The next sub-expression tests for a white-space character, which is mandatory in order to match pattern 1. “(?:\\\\s)”+ Any non-alphanumeric character, except for whitespaces and characters that are part of a markup substitution, can follow the whitespace. This sub-expression allows additional punctuation marks, brackets and similar characters before the next word starts. “(?:[^\\\\w]|(?:S/§)|(?:[0-9]+(?=/§)))*”+ The last sub-expression belonging to the test for pattern 1 searches for an alphanumeric character that is not part of a markup substitution. If the SWTagger finds such a character, it assumes the beginning of a new word. “(?:[a-zA-Z0-9](?!/§)))”+ If the SW-Tagger fails to match the first main pattern, it checks for a second one, which represents words that are separated by an XML tag, but no whitespaces. “|”+ The SW-Tagger attempts to match the second pattern by looking for the last alphanumeric character in a sequence (word or numeric expression) that is not part of a markup substitution, but directly followed by a markup substitution. “(?:(?:[a-zA-Z0-9](?!(?:\\\\w)|(?:/§)|(?:[\\\\.,]? [0-9]+?))[,\\\\.;\\\\?!\\&quot;&#x27;\\\\=/:&amp;+\\\\-\\\\$%°]*(?=\\\\*§[0-9]+/§ ))” + Non-alphanumeric characters, markup substitutions or a sentence markup can follow the first sub-pattern of pattern 2. “(?:[^\\\\w]|(?:S/§)|(?:[0-9]+(?=/§)))*”+ This sub-expression causes the SW-Tagger to ignore punctuation marks, brackets or sentence boundaries between words. The end of the second main\n\n300\n\nAppendix\n\npattern must be an alphanumeric character that is not part of a markup substitution. “(?:[a-zA-Z0-9](?!(?:/§))))” To check the quality of the SW-Tagger’s markup procedure, we randomly sampled four documents from four journals and inspected the markup for three paragraphs in each document. For words, we found 2,092 correctly identified instances, six incorrect separations and no misses. Five of the six errors originated from one document that states the names of places and tribes in native African languages. These words contained unusual combinations of diacritics and hyphens that caused the word split-up heuristics to fail. The SW-Tagger’s word markup procedure achieved a precision of 99 % and a recall of 100 %. The detection for sentences was error-free in the sample. Overall, we are confident that the SW-Tagger’s markup procedure is highly accurate.\n\nB.2 Data Parser The data parser extracts all information necessary for a CbPD analysis from NXML texts. This task requires evaluating the original XML markup and the plain text markup for sentences and words that the SW-Tagger introduced to the documents during the pre-processing step. We implemented the data parser according to the Simple API for XML (SAX) [272]. SAX allows easy extraction of citation positions compared to other APIs for XML parsing and offers high processing speed ([347], p. 36). SAX follows a push approach for accessing data in XML documents. This means a parser implementing the SAX API reads and triggers (i.e. &quot;pushes&quot;) a notification when it detects one of five predefined events. Encountering the start or end tag of the whole document or arbitrary elements represents one event each, thus totaling four events. The fifth event is the encountering of literal character data. Only the application that invokes the SAX parser defines reactions for events that the SAX parser reports. For this purpose, the invoking application must provide callback handlers to the SAX parser. These handlers contain and execute programming logic dependent on the event they receive from the SAX parser.\n\nB Technical Details of the CitePlag Prototype\n\n301\n\nThe content handler is the callback handler of the data parser that extracts document metadata, citations, and references. For most data elements, such as document IDs, author names, and references, this extraction is straightforward. Likewise, citations are easy to parse when the respective NXML text contains individual tags for every citation. However, some texts state several citations in an abbreviated fashion, for example, “[3 – 8]” without offering XML markup for all citations in the range. To recognize these notations, we implemented an additional check to see if citations occur within a range of 13 or less characters. We chose thirteen characters by assuming that a notation similar to this: “[110] – [115]” is the likely maximum length of an abbreviated citation range. If citations occur within the 13-character-interval, the content handler uses regular expressions to check whether the literal character data between the citation tags actually represents a citation range. To keep track of sentence and word counts, we adapted the method of the callback handler that reacts to event notifications for literal character data. We use regular expressions to recognize the sentence and word markup introduced in the pre-processing step. After gathering all data for an element, for example a citation, the content handler submits the element to the database. In order to analyze research papers, while ignoring additional content in PMC, including editorial letters, book reviews, etc., we selected only those documents in the PMC OAS of the following types: &quot;research-article&quot;, &quot;reviewarticle&quot;, &quot;case-report&quot;, &quot;brief-report&quot;, &quot;report&quot; and &quot;other&quot;. We also excluded documents containing more than one text body or no text body. Samples indicated that documents without a text body are mostly scanned versions of older articles that express only metadata in NXML. Documents with multiple text body parts were usually conference reviews that list summaries of proceeding articles. Both of these document types are not relevant for a plagiarism analysis. The exclusions affected ‫׽‬13,000 documents. In total, we imported 221,220 documents to the CitePlag database.\n\n302\n\nAppendix\n\nB.3 Consolidation of Reference Identifiers We consolidated available document identifiers after importing the data into the CitePlag database. When possible, we assigned all identifiers available for a document to all references that likely point to that document and corrected reference records in the database that had incorrect identifiers assigned to them. To achieve this, we identified all likely valid relationships between identifiers and documents by applying the following procedure: First, we selected all PMIDs, MEDIDs, DOIs, RefTitKeys, and RefAuthKeys and took each of these identifiers as a seed to build all combinations with other identifiers. For example, taking PMIDs as the seed, we selected all pairwise combinations of PMID-DOI, PMID-MEDID, PMID-RefAuthKey, and PMID-RefTitKey. To improve accuracy, we only considered identifier combinations that were identical in at least two documents. During this process, we recognized that RefAuthKey is too error-prone for use as a seed, because we do not disambiguate author names. If we encountered non-unique combinations of identifiers, we chose the combination used by the majority of authors and ignored the other combinations. Assuming that the most frequently used combination of, for example, a given PMID and DOI, is likely the correct mapping, we consolidated all ambiguous pairwise mappings of document identifiers. Second, we joined the consolidated pairwise-unique mappings of document identifiers using the respective seed identifier in the mappings as the join criterion. This step yielded the following four combined mappings for the respective seed identifiers: 1. PMID-DOI-MEDID-RefAuthKey-RefTitKey 2. DOI-PMID-MEDID-RefAuthKey-RefTitKey 3. MEDID-PMID-DOI-RefAuthKey-RefTitKey 4. RefTitKey-PMID-DOI MEDID-RefAuthKey\n\nB Technical Details of the CitePlag Prototype\n\n303\n\nThird, we joined the mappings 1 through 4 consecutively to the table of all references using the respective seed identifier of the mappings as the join criterion. If reference records matched one of the mappings in at least one additional identifier aside from the seed identifier, we updated all data fields of the reference record to equal the mapping. Mapping 4, which uses the artificially computed RefTitKey as the seed identifier, is more error-prone than the other mappings. Therefore, we used mapping 4 only to alter records that offered no other document identifier. Table 29: Consolidation of Reference Identifiers Before Consolidation No. of Ref.\n\nDocument Identifier\n\nTotal PMID no PMID, DOI no PMID, no DOI, MEDID No identifiers, authors, title No title and/or authors\n\nAfter Consolidation\n\nNo. of dist.

The table states the number of references for which the respective type of document identifier is available. Authors most often stated PMIDs when citing sources. DOIs and MEDIDs were the second and third most frequent choice. The table shows the quantities of available document identifiers according to the most commonly used document identifier for an individual reference. For example, if the string for a reference included a PMID\n\n304\n\nAppendix\n\nand a DOI, we counted it for the PMID category only. The table also lists the totals for distinct document identifiers before and after consolidation. During the consolidation, we assigned PMIDs to ‫׽‬100,000 references that had no assigned PMIDs before consolidation. We were able to reduce the number of references without numeric identifiers by ‫׽‬58,000. Additionally, we reduced the number of distinct PMIDs by ‫׽‬3,000 and the number of distinct DOIs by ‫׽‬17,000. This reduction in distinct identifiers suggests that we significantly reduced the numbers of non-unique identifiers.\n\nB.4 Database Documentation This section presents more details on the database structure of the CitePlag prototype briefly introduced in Section 5.2.

The following text is a copy of the US-Patent application for Co-citation Proximity Analysis [128]. For additional information please visit: http://www.patentstorm.us/applications/20110264672/description.html The following patent is included in this appendix:\n\nMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETECTING A SIMILARITY OF DOCUMENTS Cross Reference to Related Applications The present application is a continuation of International Application Number PCT/DE2009/000017 filed on January 8, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method and a system for detecting a similarity of documents. The invention particularly relates to a method and a system for detecting a similarity of documents, wherein similar documents are detected and possibly provided based on a predetermined document.\n\nE Patent Application\n\n319\n\n320\n\nAppendix\n\nE Patent Application\n\n321\n\n322\n\nAppendix\n\nE Patent Application\n\n323\n\n324\n\nAppendix\n\nE Patent Application\n\n325\n\n326\n\nAppendix\n\nE Patent Application\n\n327\n\n328\n\nAppendix\n\nF\n\nUser Study Feedback\n\nAs part of the user study, participants had the opportunity to submit comments and suggestions on their perceived usefulness of the citation-based approach. Table 31 shows excerpts of responses collected in the user study. Table 31: User Comments on CbPD “[CbPD shows]... a similarity which I find valuable to see.“ “[The citation pattern visualization] helped me come to a quicker conclusion. Sometimes [CbPD] helped either strengthen or weaken my opinion on similarity. For example, if shake &amp; paste plagiarism also clearly shared citation patterns, I arrived at a conclusion more quickly72.” “...when many key words overlapped, but the citation patterns around shared words were unique, CbPD helps to show legitimate similarity.” “...[CbPD adds a]... new level of document similarity that I was unaware of before.” “Judging plagiarism is quick when two documents have text overlaps, but when the text is adjusted or rearranged, it is much more difficult to assess documents and to find any overlap in their content. It requires a deep background knowledge on the topic and also the cited works. The citation visualization really helps to better assess the content similarity when the text does not overlap. This makes it faster and easier, especially for an examiner who is not familiar with a particular topic!”\n\nSome users expressed uncertainty regarding the value of citations. They felt citation-based similarity allowed them no quick way of knowing what similarity should still be considered &quot;normal&quot;. However, the threshold problem for &quot;acceptable&quot; similarity also exists for character-based measures. The reality is 72\n\nTranslated from German. Comment submitted by a General Medical Practitioner.\n\n330\n\nAppendix\n\nthat no quick or easy fix exists to categorize a given similarity among documents as clearly suspicious. One of the experts commented that for documents with high semantic similarity with no notable text similarity, the addition of very fine-grained text similarity visualization, i.e. ten or less matching characters was helpful for discerning if the patterns of medical key words, especially surrounding shared citations were suspiciously similar.\n\nG Reactions of Contacted Authors Of the top-40 document pairs rated as most suspicious by user study participant, two publications had already been retracted. One publication [281] was retracted as a result of a previous email exchange we had with the earlier authors, while the other case [165] had already been retracted at the time of detection by the CbPD algorithms. We emailed73 the authors of the remaining 38 earlier published articles asking them if they:\n\nwere aware of the later published article?\n\n\nknew of any reasons which may explain the similarity of the later article?\n\n\nsaw any indications for plagiarism?\n\nThe authors of 20 articles replied74. The authors of six articles confirmed the presence of plagiarism, one additional author confirmed plagiarism, but wished to take no action75, and the authors of nine papers acknowledged similarities, but did not consider them as crucial enough to initiate a retraction process. The authors of two papers simply replied a “thank you” refusing to comment on plagiarism, and the authors of the final two publications replied they were not technically versed enough to utilize or make sense of the prototype visualization. Many authors expressed gratitude for being made aware of the plagiarism of their work. Table 32 lists some of the email responses from the authors we contacted.\n\n73 74 75\n\nAll authors were contacted 2013-05-06, unless specified otherwise. As of 2013-05-31. Refer to the comment beginning “I don&#x27;t know if...” on page 334 for an explanation.\n\n332\n\nAppendix Table 32: Original Author Comments on CbPD “To be honest I am quite shocked. The resemblance is indeed more than striking. [...] your tool seems to be very efficacious indeed.” ...the degree of overlap seems to me to be most consistent with over-reliance on our paper for language and structure by the authors of the later paper.” “I was not aware of this later paper and I do not know of any reasons which may explain the similarity of the later article to ours. “The results which you have shown are mind boggling.. I simply don&#x27;t know how to respond...I find no reasons for both the manuscripts to be so similar. Introductions can be similar to some extent, but almost the entire discussion seems to be copied as it is. Their images do not show any evidence of skin graft being used, where discussion mentions of skin grafts!!! ...I see every indication for plagiarism in this particular article. It is definitely more than just coincidence. Unfortunately, our article has not even been cited by the manuscript.” “...your approach is reasonable, and I applaud the success of your program” “Your program is very nice and surprising! We have not been aware of the existence of the later article.” “Your work raises the question of reviewing. Why wasn&#x27;t this detected by the reviewers?” “I looked at your analysis and I am amazed. We were definitely plagiarized and I was not aware of this article. [...] The best evidence is the results of your algorithm.” “I&#x27;m quite surprised... I did not know that paper and I do not know its authors. It seems that they just copied and pasted most of the discussion section and the bibliography of my paper without changing even a single word. I think this is a clear example of plagiarism” “I was not aware of this later published article. I find no reason for the similarity (identity) of the articles. I am completely sure it is a case of plagiarism76.”\n\n76\n\nExcerpt from an email exchange on 2012-09-03.\n\nG Reactions of Contacted Authors\n\n333\n\nTo guarantee anonymity to the individual authors quoted here, we do not disclose their names. Disclosure of full names is available only upon request77. The gamut of responses we received were in line with the types of responses collected in similar investigations of potential plagiarism. For a study examining precisely the responses of all involved parties that result from investigating plagiarism, refer to [202]. The responses we received from the original authors, who rejected the presence of plagiarism, showed that the opinions on what constitutes plagiarism continue to differ. A first case in which authors felt that high similarity was acceptable was in introductory or overview sections. According to one set of authors, introductory phrases ‘set the stage’ of a paper and may be copied in publications, given that they serve to point out the scientific niche the paper will occupy. As one set of authors78 argues, generic ‘stage-setting’ statements were not part of the author’s unique contribution and thus should not be viewed as plagiarism: “the [...] sentences [...] are indeed similar. [They] ‘set the stage’ by pointing out how health care can be unsafe. They are not a part of the authors’ unique contributions.” T.A., B.G., L.S. A second case in which citation pattern similarity was viewed as justified by authors was for case reports and review studies. Such reports tend to follow standardized forms, often using boilerplate text, as pointed out by the following author: “Both papers are study design papers of Dutch studies. The recent study was modeled using elements of the first study. Record review studies are highly standardized. This clarifies the similarities.” M.B. 77\n\n78\n\nWe also decided against using author initials, since the identity of the publications’ original authors can easily be revealed once the retracted cases are made public. This would jeopardize the anonymity of authors who communicated confidentially with us by email. Excerpt from an email exchange on 2012-10-10.\n\n334\n\nAppendix\n\nA third example of author-approved citation pattern similarity affected review articles: “the similarity [...] is normal because we wrote about the same topic and it is normal to use the same references because both papers are reviews and the field is so small (I mean the people working in the field are not so many so obviously we are all going to use the same references and same words).” A final – albeit a most controversial example of similarity considered “legitimate” – was pointed out by an author, who argued that the different definition on &quot;acceptable borrowing&quot; of text in developing countries should not be ignored: “I don&#x27;t know if there are technical criteria for declaring a document to have been plagiarized....My lenient reaction is no doubt colored by having trained many scientists from developing countries whose first language is not English. Not only must they rely on published English-language work to help them formulate wording for their own work, but the cultural norms for what is considered acceptable &quot;borrowing&quot; of language tend to be more permissive in developing countries than in the U.S.” We were also reminded of the fear of consequences authors face for accusing others of plagiarism. The authors of one paper were not willing to approach the journal and expose the plagiarists themselves: “We are not willing to do this job ourselves because this will lead to great conflict with the author of the second paper who is living in the same country, even though we do not know him personally.”\n\nG Reactions of Contacted Authors\n\n335\n\nIt was common for authors to express their disbelief and surprise of the plagiarism having gone undetected for so long. Many expressed their concern regarding the quality of peer review and the ability of current detection approaches to identify strongly disguised plagiarism forms beyond copy &amp; paste. One author was of the opinion that automated plagiarism detection presented an important area of research, in which CbPD was: “a useful step in development of more sophisticated methods.”\n\nH Empirical Studies on Plagiarism Frequencies Table 33: Studies Pertaining to North American Colleges Source\n\nSample size, place and time of collection\n\nMethod\n\nResults\n\n[277]\n\n447 undergraduates at one U.S. campus Spring term 1997\n\nself-report survey\n\n50 % copied from fellow students with their consent, 24.3 % without 35.6 % committed partial plagiarism\n\n[45]\n\n71 students at one U.S. campus Spring term 1998\n\nself-report survey\n\n67.2 % committed partial plagiarism 26.8 submitted a paper from an external source\n\n[283]\n\n698 students at nine U.S. campuses Academic year 1999/2000\n\nself-report survey\n\n19.0 % committed partial plagiarism “sometimes” 5.4 % submitted a paper from an external source “sometimes”\n\n[176]\n\nUnknown number of undergraduates at one U.S. campus publication date: Aug. 2003\n\nself-report survey\n\n[220]\n\n60,691 students at 67 U.S. institutions 21,649 students at 16 Canadian institutions Academic years 2002/2003, 2004/2005\n\nself-report survey\n\n38 % undergrad., 25 % grad. committed partial plagiarism 8 % undergrad., 4 % grad. copied from another source (within 12 months prior to the survey)\n\n[46]\n\n91 students at one U.S. campus Fall term 2004\n\nself-report survey\n\n53.2 % committed partial plagiarism 31.2 % submitted a paper from an external source\n\n[223]\n\n5,331 graduate students at 32 campuses in the USA\n\nself-report survey\n\n53 % of business majors, 43 % of other students cheated on written work\n\n47.1 % committed plagiarism\n\nH Empirical Studies on Plagiarism Frequencies and Canada\n\n[273]\n\n337\n\nAcademic years 2003/2004, 2004/2005\n\n33 % of business majors, 22 % other students literally copied from the internet (within 12 months prior to the survey)\n\n1,225 students at one U.S. campus Observation period unspecified, publication date: Jun. 2007\n\n62.6 % copied homework from fellow students 44.5 % plagiarized from internet 17.9 % copied term papers or projects from fellow students\n\nself-report survey\n\nTable 34: Studies Pertaining to Colleges Outside of North America Source\n\nSample size, place, time of collection\n\nMethod\n\nResults\n\n[194]\n\n518 students from three institutions in Singapore; Observation period unspecified; Publication date: July 2001\n\nself-report survey\n\n89.8 % plagiarized by paraphrasing 85.1 % copied literally from books, articles etc. 56.5 % copied papers from fellow students with or without their consent\n\n[212]\n\n954 students from four Australian universities; Observation period unspecified; Publication date: May 2005\n\nself-report survey\n\n81 % committed plagiarism\n\n[83]\n\n2002/2003: 145 undergraduates 2003/2004: 207 undergraduates from\n\nAssignments checked with\n\n79\n\n‫׽‬40 % of students had NOS&gt;=20 % in both academic years analyzed79\n\nNon-Originality Score (NOS); documents scoring NOS&gt;10 % are typically regarded as suspicious and likely to contain plagiarism.\n\n338\n\nAppendix one institution in the UK\n\n[23]\n\n[303]\n\n182 graduate students from one institution in the UK Observation period unspecified; Publication date: 2006\n\n159 students from one institution in the UK; Observation period unspecified; Publication date: June 2008\n\nOrCheck Assignments checked with Turnitin; Suspicious documents inspected manually\n\nTurnitin flagged 40.6 % of all documents as suspicious Manual inspection revealed 26 % of all documents contained actual plagiarism\n\nself-report survey\n\n68.6 % plagiarized by paraphrasing (23.9 % frequently) 59.7 % copied material literally from books, articles etc. (24.5 % frequently) 21.4 % copied from fellow students (5.7 % frequently) 17.5 % submitted a paper from an external source, (3.7 % frequently)\n\n[332]\n\n322 undergraduates From three Swedish universities\n\nself-report survey\n\n61 % copied material literally from books, articles etc. 55 % copied from fellow students with their consent, 9 % without 31 % submitted a paper from an external source\n\n[329]\n\n‫׽‬1,300 MA and PhD thesis at one Turkish university Submissions between 2001 and 2010\n\nAssignments checked with Turnitin\n\n22.3 % of thesis had 21 %&lt;=x&lt;=30 % NOS (NOS&gt;15 % was considered suspicious by this study [85] )\n\nI\n\nStudies on Citation-based Similarity Measures\n\nThe following three tables summarize studies, which assessed the applicability of citation-based similarity measures for different retrieval tasks. Studies commonly analyzed the suitability of different measures for creating topic-centered clusters of research articles [4, 38, 39, 166, 167, 200, 244] or web pages [53, 54, 79, 86, 352]. Table 35 lists studies exclusively analyzing citation-based measures, while Table 36 outlines studies that compared character-based and citation-based similarity measures side-by-side. Table 37 highlights studies that also evaluated hybrid measures, which combined both approaches.\n\n340\n\nAppendix Table 35: Studies Evaluating Citation-based Similarity Measures Objective of Study\n\nSimilarity Measures\n\nGold Standard\n\nTest collection\n\n[86]: Find relevant web pages for given input URLs\n\nCo-citation (CoCit), Companion\n\n18 expert judgments\n\n59 input URLs selected by experts, top-10 recommendations of each approach\n\n[4]: Subject classification for research articles\n\nBibCoup, Abstract keywords\n\n1 expert judgments\n\n43 IR articles\n\n[295]: Perf. of similarity measures to identify research front\n\nBibCoup, CoCit, Direct Citation\n\nTopological clustering (defined criteria)\n\nArticles retrieved by keyword search from SCI\n\n[369]: Identify topically similar papers\n\nBibCoup, CoCit, Amsler, Inter Conn.\n\nPrediction of reference papers given in textbook chapters\n\nDBLP and reference information crawled from MS Academic Search\n\nI Studies on Citation-based Similarity Measures\n\n341\n\nTable 36: Studies Primarily Evaluating Citation-based Similarity Measures Study, Objective\n\nSimilarity Measure\n\nGold Standard\n\nTest collection\n\nComparison of similarity measures for topical similarity (our own study [134])\n\nBibCoup, CoCit, Amsler, Co-citation Proximity Analysis, CoCit, Lucene\n\nInformation content analysis derived from MeSH thesaurus\n\n‫׽‬260,000 documents from the PubMed Central Open Access Subset\n\n[39]: Subject clustering, creation of topic maps for research articles\n\nCoCit, Vector Space Model (VSM)\n\n1 expert interview per analyzed domain\n\n‫׽‬3,400 and ‫׽‬1,300 articles from two research fields\n\n[352]: Web page clustering\n\nBibCoup, CoCit, anchor texts\n\nRelevance judgment by the authors\n\n200 web pages for each of 8 topics\n\n[168]: Evaluate suitability of similarity measures to identify research front\n\nBibCoup and CoCit combined with title keyword clustering\n\nNone; clustering derived from assumptions made\n\n‫׽‬73,000 environmental research articles from SCI\n\n342\n\nAppendix Table 37: Studies Evaluating Hybrid Measures Study, Objective\n\nSimilarity Measures\n\n[166]: Subject clustering, creation of topic maps for research articles\n\nBibCoup, VSM of titles and abstracts, chi-square combination of both\n\nMeSH\n\n5,188 papers retrieved by journal selection, keyword search etc.\n\n[53, 54, 79, 80]: Subject classification for web pages\n\nBibCoup,CoCit, Amsler, Compan., kNN with tf/idf VSM, SVM, Naïve Bayes classifier\n\nExpert classifications\n\n2 sets of manually pre-classified web pages; in [79] further ‫׽‬6,600 articles from ACM DL\n\n[3]: Subject classification for research articles\n\nBibCoup, termbased approach, combination of both\n\nOne expert clustering\n\n43 IR articles\n\n[167]: Subject clustering, creation of topic maps for articles\n\nVarious citationbased, tf/idf VSM, linear combinations\n\nExternal: Thomson Reuters Essential Science Indicators\n\n‫׽‬6 million papers, ‫׽‬8,000 journals from Web of Science\n\n[200, 201]: Clustering of research articles\n\ncharacter-based, various citationbased LSI of binary article cross-citation, combination of text- and citation-based measures\n\nGold Standard\n\nInternal: Mean Silhouette Value, Modularity\n\nTest collection\n\nJ\n\nOverview of Selected PDS\n\nGiven the fast-paced changes in the software landscape for plagiarism detection, this section presents some established systems that are well-maintained and find widespread use for the comparison of academic documents. Table 38 presents PDS that focus on collusion detection by employing a user-defined corpus. PDS that compare documents to external collections are typically web-based. Major vendors, including Ephorus, SafeAssign, Turnitin, and Urkund, maintain large indices of the web and exclusive non-publicly available content, including journal articles, books, and prior works submitted for inspection. Turnitin calls itself the global leader in PD and claims to continuously index ‫׽‬24 billion web pages, ‫׽‬250 million student papers, and ‫׽‬100 million books and periodicals [164]. The comparison algorithms of all commercial PDS are trade secrets. However, given the size of the reference collection, we conclude that the systems must apply approaches requiring low computational effort, which suggests commercial PDS most likely use fingerprinting. Table 39 summarizes systems that check documents against an external collection. The last columns in both tables list publications that offer details on detection procedures and system performance. Information on the exact algorithms used in commercial tools is not publicly available.\n\n344\n\nAppendix Table 38: PDS for Document Comparisons within a User-Defined Corpus System/ Manufacturer\n\nDetection Approach\n\nLicense/Costs\n\nAntiPlagiarist [2]\n\nclient software: local installation procedure: word-based string matching\n\nCommercial $34.95\n\nCopyCatch [60]\n\nclient software: local installation procedure: string matching\n\nCommercial individual price\n\nEncoplot [143]\n\nclient software: local installation procedure: fingerprinting using 16-charactergrams\n\nFreeware; Open source\n\nSource [355]\n\n[50, 89, 353]\n\n[142, 143]\n\nFerret [186]\n\nclient software: local installation procedure: word-3-gram fingerprinting\n\n[22, 203, 204]\n\nSherlock [184]\n\nclient software: local installation procedure: word-n-gram fingerprinting\n\nFreeware; Open source\n\n[184]\n\nWCopyFind [35]\n\nclient software: local installation procedure: word-based string matching\n\nFreeware; Open source\n\n[94, 282, 355]\n\nFreeware\n\nJ Overview of Selected PDS\n\n345\n\nPDS that compare documents to external collections are typically web-based.
