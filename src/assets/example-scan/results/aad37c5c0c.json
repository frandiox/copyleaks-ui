The widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet have made it easier to plagiarize the work of others.[1][2]\n\nDetection of plagiarism can be undertaken in a variety of ways. Human detection is the most traditional form of identifying plagiarism from written work; this can be a lengthy and time-consuming task for the reader[2] and can also result in inconsistencies in how plagiarism is identified within an organization.[3] Text-matching software (TMS), which is also referred to as \"plagiarism detection software\" or \"anti-plagiarism\" software, has become widely available, in the form of both commercially available products as well as open-source software. TMS does not actually detect plagiarism per se, but instead finds specific passages of text in one document that match text in another document.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Software-assisted plagiarism detection\n\n1.1 In text documents\n\n1.1.1 Effectiveness of in higher education settings\n\n1.1.2 Approaches\n\n1.1.2.1 Fingerprinting\n\n1.1.2.2 String matching\n\n1.1.2.3 Bag of words\n\n1.1.2.4 Citation analysis\n\n1.1.2.5 Stylometry\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Performance\n\n1.1.4 Software\n\n\n\n\n1.2 In source code\n\n\n\n\n2 Complications with the use of text-matching software for plagiarism detection\n\n3 See also\n\n4 References\n\n5 Literature\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware-assisted plagiarism detection[edit]\nComputer-assisted plagiarism detection (CaPD) is an Information retrieval (IR) task supported by specialized IR systems, which is referred to as a plagiarism detection system (PDS).\n\n\nIn text documents[edit]\nSystems for text-plagiarism detection implement one of two generic detection approaches, one being external, the other being intrinsic.[4]\nExternal detection systems compare a suspicious document with a reference collection, which is a set of documents assumed to be genuine.[5]\nBased on a chosen document model and predefined similarity criteria, the detection task is to retrieve all documents that contain text that is similar to a degree above a chosen threshold to text in the suspicious document.[6]\nIntrinsic PDSes solely analyze the text to be evaluated without performing comparisons to external documents; this approach aims to recognize changes in the unique writing style of an author as an indicator for potential plagiarism.[7]\nPDSes are not capable of reliably identifying plagiarism without human judgment. Similarities are computed with the help of predefined document models and might represent false positives.[8][9][10][11][12]\n\n\nEffectiveness of in higher education settings[edit]\n\nThis section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources.  (December 2017)\n\nA study was conducted to test the effectiveness of plagiarism detection software in a higher education setting. One part of the study assigned one group of students to write a paper; these students were first educated about plagiarism and informed that their work was to be run through a plagiarism detection system. A second group of students was assigned to write a paper without any information about plagiarism; the researchers expected to find lower rates in group one but found roughly the same rates of plagiarism in both groups.[13]\n\n\nApproaches[edit]\nThe figure below represents a classification of all detection approaches currently in use for computer-assisted plagiarism detection; the approaches are characterized by the type of similarity assessment they undertake: global or local. Global similarity assessment approaches use the characteristics taken from larger parts of the text or the document as a whole to compute similarity, while local methods only examine pre-selected text segments as input.\n\n\n  \nClassification of computer-assisted plagiarism detection methods\n\n\n\n\nFingerprinting[edit]\nFingerprinting is currently the most widely applied approach to plagiarism detection; this method forms representative digests of documents by selecting a set of multiple substrings (n-grams) from them. The sets represent the fingerprints and their elements are called minutiae.[14][15]\nA suspicious document is checked for plagiarism by computing its fingerprint and querying minutiae with a precomputed index of fingerprints for all documents of a reference collection. Minutiae matching with those of other documents indicate shared text segments and suggest potential plagiarism if they exceed a chosen similarity threshold.[16] Computational resources and time are limiting factors to fingerprinting, which is why this method typically only compares a subset of minutiae to speed up the computation and allow for checks in very large collection, such as the Internet.[14]\n\n\nString matching[edit]\nString matching is a prevalent approach used in computer science; when applied to the problem of plagiarism detection, documents are compared for verbatim text overlaps. Numerous methods have been proposed to tackle this task, of which some have been adapted to external plagiarism detection. Checking a suspicious document in this setting requires the computation and storage of efficiently comparable representations for all documents in the reference collection to compare them pairwise. Generally, suffix document models, such as suffix trees or suffix vectors, have been used for this task. Nonetheless, substring matching remains computationally expensive, which makes it a non-viable solution for checking large collections of documents.[17][18][19]\n\n\nBag of words[edit]\n Bag of words analysis represents the adoption of vector space retrieval, a traditional IR concept, to the domain of plagiarism detection. Documents are represented as one or multiple vectors, e.g. for different document parts, which are used for pair wise similarity computations. Similarity computation may then rely on the traditional cosine similarity measure, or on more sophisticated similarity measures.[20][21][22]\n\n\nCitation analysis[edit]\nCitation-based plagiarism detection (CbPD)[23] relies on citation analysis, and is the only approach to plagiarism detection that does not rely on the textual similarity.[24] CbPD examines the citation and reference information in texts to identify similar patterns in the citation sequences; as such, this approach is suitable for scientific texts, or other academic documents that contain citations. Citation analysis to detect plagiarism is a relatively young concept, it has not been adopted by commercial software, but a first prototype of a citation-based plagiarism detection system exists.[25] Similar order and proximity of citations in the examined documents are the main criteria used to compute citation pattern similarities. Citation patterns represent subsequences non-exclusively containing citations shared by the documents compared.[24][26] Factors, including the absolute number or relative fraction of shared citations in the pattern, as well as the probability that citations co-occur in a document are also considered to quantify the patterns’ degree of similarity.[24][26][27][28]\n\n\nStylometry[edit]\nStylometry subsumes statistical methods for quantifying an author’s unique writing style[29][30] and is mainly used for authorship attribution or intrinsic CaPD. By constructing and comparing stylometric models for different text segments, passages that are stylistically different from others, hence potentially plagiarized, can be detected.[7]\n\n\nPerformance[edit]\nComparative evaluations of plagiarism detection systems[5][31][32][33][34][35] indicate that their performance depends on the type of plagiarism present (see figure). Except for citation pattern analysis, all detection approaches rely on textual similarity, it is therefore symptomatic that detection accuracy decreases the more plagiarism cases are obfuscated.\n\n\n  \nDetection performance of CaPD approaches depending on the type of plagiarism being present\n\n\n\n\nLiteral copies, aka copy and paste (c&amp;p) plagiarism, or modestly disguised plagiarism cases can be detected with high accuracy by current external PDS if the source is accessible to the software. Especially substring matching procedures achieve a good performance for c&amp;p plagiarism, since they commonly use lossless document models, such as suffix trees; the performance of systems using fingerprinting or bag of words analysis in detecting copies depends on the information loss incurred by the document model used. By applying flexible chunking and selection strategies, they are better capable of detecting moderate forms of disguised plagiarism when compared to substring matching procedures.\n\nIntrinsic plagiarism detection using stylometry can overcome the boundaries of textual similarity to some extent by comparing linguistic similarity. Given that the stylistic differences between plagiarized and original segments are significant and can be identified reliably, stylometry can help in identifying disguised and paraphrased plagiarism. Stylometric comparisons are likely to fail in cases where segments are strongly paraphrased to the point where they more closely resemble the personal writing style of the plagiarist or if a text was compiled by multiple authors; the results of the International Competitions on Plagiarism Detection held in 2009, 2010 and 2011,[5][34][35] as well as experiments performed by Stein,[36] indicate that stylometric analysis seems to work reliably only for document lengths of several thousand or tens of thousands of words, which limits the applicability of the method to CaPD settings.\n\nAn increasing amount of research is performed on methods and systems capable of detecting translated plagiarisms. Currently, cross-language plagiarism detection (CLPD) is not viewed as a mature technology[37] and respective systems have not been able to achieve satisfying detection results in practice.[33]\n\nCitation-based plagiarism detection using citation pattern analysis is capable of identifying stronger paraphrases and translations with higher success rates when compared to other detection approaches, because it is independent of textual characteristics.[24][27] However, since citation-pattern analysis depends on the availability of sufficient citation information, it is limited to academic texts, it remains inferior to text-based approaches in detecting shorter plagiarized passages, which are typical for cases of copy-and-paste or shake-and-paste plagiarism; the latter refers to mixing slightly altered fragments from different sources.[38]\n\n\nSoftware[edit]\n\tThe design of plagiarism detection software for use with text documents is characterized by a number of factors:[citation needed]\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\n\nDescription and alternatives\n\n\nScope of search\n\nIn the public internet, using search engines / Institutional databases / Local, system-specific database.[citation needed]\n\n\nAnalysis time\n\nDelay between the time a document is submitted and the time when results are made available.[citation needed]\n\n\nDocument capacity / Batch processing\n\nNumber of documents the system can process per unit of time.[citation needed]\n\n\nCheck intensity\n\nHow often and for which types of document fragments (paragraphs, sentences, fixed-length word sequences) does the system query external resources, such as search engines.\n\n\nComparison algorithm type\n\nThe algorithms that define the way the system uses to compare documents against each other.[citation needed]\n\n\nPrecision and Recall\n\nNumber of documents correctly flagged as plagiarized compared to the total number of flagged documents, and to the total number of documents that were actually plagiarized. High precision means that few false positives were found, and high recall means that few false negatives were left undetected.[citation needed]\n\nMost large-scale plagiarism detection systems use large, internal databases (in addition to other resources) that grow with each additional document submitted for analysis. However, this feature is considered by some as a violation of student copyright.[citation needed]\n\n\nIn source code[edit]\nPlagiarism in computer source code is also frequent, and requires different tools than those used for text comparisons in document. Significant research has been dedicated to academic source-code plagiarism.[39]\n\nA distinctive aspect of source-code plagiarism is that there are no essay mills, such as can be found in traditional plagiarism. Since most programming assignments expect students to write programs with very specific requirements, it is very difficult to find existing programs that already meet them. Since integrating external code is often harder than writing it from scratch, most plagiarizing students choose to do so from their peers.\n\nAccording to Roy and Cordy,[40] source-code similarity detection algorithms can be classified as based on either\n\n\nStrings – look for exact textual matches of segments, for instance five-word runs. Fast, but can be confused by renaming identifiers.\n\nTokens – as with strings, but using a lexer to convert the program into tokens first. This discards whitespace, comments, and identifier names, making the system more robust to simple text replacements. Most academic plagiarism detection systems work at this level, using different algorithms to measure the similarity between token sequences.\n\nParse Trees – build and compare parse trees. This allows higher-level similarities to be detected. For instance, tree comparison can normalize conditional statements, and detect equivalent constructs as similar to each other.\n\nProgram Dependency Graphs (PDGs) – a PDG captures the actual flow of control in a program, and allows much higher-level equivalences to be located, at a greater expense in complexity and calculation time.\n\nMetrics – metrics capture 'scores' of code segments according to certain criteria; for instance, \"the number of loops and conditionals\", or \"the number of different variables used\". Metrics are simple to calculate and can be compared quickly, but can also lead to false positives: two fragments with the same scores on a set of metrics may do entirely different things.\n\nHybrid approaches – for instance, parse trees + suffix trees can combine the detection capability of parse trees with the speed afforded by suffix trees, a type of string-matching data structure.\n\nThe previous classification was developed for code refactoring, and not for academic plagiarism detection (an important goal of refactoring is to avoid duplicate code, referred to as code clones in the literature); the above approaches are effective against different levels of similarity; low-level similarity refers to identical text, while high-level similarity can be due to similar specifications. In an academic setting, when all students are expected to code to the same specifications, functionally equivalent code (with high-level similarity) is entirely expected, and only low-level similarity is considered as proof of cheating.\n\n\nComplications with the use of text-matching software for plagiarism detection[edit]\nVarious complications have been documented with the use of text-matching software when used for plagiarism detection. One of the more prevalent concerns documented centers on the issue of intellectual property rights; the basic argument is that materials must be added to a database in order for the TMS to effectively determine a match, but adding users' materials to such a database may infringe on their intellectual property rights. The issue has been raised in a number of court cases.\n\nAn additional complication with the use of TMS is that the software finds only precise matches to other text, it does not pick up poorly paraphrased work, for example, or the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, which is known as rogeting.\n\n\nSee also[edit]\nCategory:Plagiarism detectors\n\nComparison of anti-plagiarism software\n\nLocality sensitive hashing\n\nNearest neighbor search\n\nParaphrase detection\n\nKolmogorov complexity#Compression – used to estimate similarity between token sequences in several systems\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Culwin, F., &amp; Lancaster, T.

Plagiarism is considered a breach of journalistic ethics, it is subject to sanctions such as penalties and expulsion from school or work. Cases of \"extreme plagiarism\" have been identified in academia; the modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in Europe in the 18th century with the Romantic movement. Plagiarism is not in itself a crime. In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense. Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not equivalent concepts, many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement, defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts. Plagiarism is not punished by law, but rather by institutions. In the 1st century, the use of the Latin word plagiarius to denote stealing someone else's work was pioneered by the Roman poet Martial, who complained that another poet had \"kidnapped his verses\". \n  Plagiary, a derivative of plagiarus, was introduced into English in 1601 by dramatist Ben Jonson during the Jacobean Era to describe someone guilty of literary theft. The derived form plagiarism was introduced into English around 1620; the Latin plagiārius, \"kidnapper\", plagium, \"kidnapping\", have the root plaga, based on the Indo-European root *-plak, \"to weave\". Although plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing, the concept does not exist in a legal sense, although the use of someone else's work in order to gain academic credit may meet some legal definitions of fraud. \"Plagiarism\" is not mentioned in any current statute, either criminal or civil. Some cases may be treated as a violation of the doctrine of moral rights; the increased availability of copyrighted material due to the development of information technology has furthered the debate as to whether copyright offences are criminal. In short, people are asked to use the guideline, \"if you did not write it yourself, you must give credit\". \n  Plagiarism is not the same as copyright infringement. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, false claims of authorship constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic credit, achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience. Plagiarism is considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is supposed to be original content. In such cases, acts of plagiarism may sometimes form part of a claim for breach of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a civil wrong. Within academia, plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered academic dishonesty or academic fraud, offenders are subject to academic censure, up to and including expulsion. \n  Some institutions use plagiarism detection software to uncover potential plagiarism and to deter students from plagiarizing. Some universities address the issue of academic integrity by providing students with thorough orientations, required writing courses, articulated honor codes. Indeed, there is a uniform understanding among college students that plagiarism is wrong; each year students are brought before their institutions’ disciplinary boards on charges that they have misused sources in their schoolwork.\" However, the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, known as rogeting, has evolved as students and unethical academics seek to stay ahead of detection software. An extreme form of plagiarism, known as contract cheating involves students paying someone else, such as an essay mill, to do their work for them. In journalism, plagiarism is considered a breach of journalistic ethics, reporters caught plagiarizing face disciplinary measures ranging from suspension to termination of employment. \n  Some individuals caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they plagiarized unintentionally, by failing to include quotations or give the appropriate citation. While plagiarism in scholarship and journalism has a centuries-old history, the development of the Internet, where articles appear as electronic text, has made the physical act of copying the work of others much easier. Predicated upon an expected level of learning/comprehension having been achieved, all associated academic accreditation becomes undermined if plagiarism is allowed to become the norm within academic submissions. For professors and researchers, plagiarism is punished by sanctions ranging from suspension to termination, along with the loss of credibility and perceived integrity. Charges of plagiarism against students and professors are heard by internal disciplinary committees, by which students and professors have agreed to \n\n\n\nCall graph\n\n\n\n\n\n A call graph is a control flow graph, which represents calling relationships between subroutines in a computer program. Each node represents a procedure and each edge indicates that procedure f calls procedure g. Thus, a cycle in the graph indicates recursive procedure calls. Call graphs can be static. A dynamic call graph is a record of an execution of the program, for example as output by a profiler. Thus, a dynamic call graph only describes one run of the program. A static call graph is a call graph intended to represent every possible run of the program; the exact static call graph is an undecidable problem, so static call graph algorithms are overapproximations. That is, every call relationship that occurs is represented in the graph, also some call relationships that would never occur in actual runs of the program. Call graphs can be defined to represent varying degrees of precision. A more precise call graph more approximates the behavior of the real program, at the cost of taking longer to compute and more memory to store. \n  The most precise call graph is context-sensitive, which means that for each procedure, the graph contains a separate node for each call stack that procedure can be activated with. A context-sensitive call graph is called a calling context tree; this can be computed dynamically although it may take up a large amount of memory. Calling context trees are not computed statically, because it would take too long for a large program; the least precise call graph is context-insensitive, which means that there is only one node for each procedure. With languages that feature dynamic dispatch, such as Java and C++, computing a static call graph requires alias analysis results. Conversely, computing precise aliasing requires a call graph. Many static analysis systems solve the apparent infinite regress by computing both simultaneously. Call graphs can be used in different ways. One simple application of call graphs is finding procedures. Call graphs can act as documentation for humans to understand programs. \n  They can serve as basis for further analyses, such as an analysis that tracks the flow of values between procedures, or change impact prediction. Call graphs can be used to detect anomalies of program execution or code injection attacks.

The ISSN is helpful in distinguishing between serials with the same title. ISSN are used in ordering, interlibrary loans, other practices in connection with serial literature; the ISSN system was first drafted as an International Organization for Standardization international standard in 1971 and published as ISO 3297 in 1975. ISO subcommittee TC 46/SC 9 is responsible for maintaining the standard; when a serial with the same content is published in more than one media type, a different ISSN is assigned to each media type. For example, many serials are published both in electronic media; the ISSN system refers to these types as electronic ISSN, respectively. Conversely, as defined in ISO 3297:2007, every serial in the ISSN system is assigned a linking ISSN the same as the ISSN assigned to the serial in its first published medium, which links together all ISSNs assigned to the serial in every medium. \n  The format of the ISSN is an eight digit code, divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers. As an integer number, it can be represented by the first seven digits; the last code digit, which may be 0-9 or an X, is a check digit. Formally, the general form of the ISSN code can be expressed as follows: NNNN-NNNC where N is in the set, a digit character, C is in; the ISSN of the journal Hearing Research, for example, is 0378-5955, where the final 5 is the check digit, C=5. To calculate the check digit, the following algorithm may be used: Calculate the sum of the first seven digits of the ISSN multiplied by its position in the number, counting from the right—that is, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, respectively: 0 ⋅ 8 + 3 ⋅ 7 + 7 ⋅ 6 + 8 ⋅ 5 + 5 ⋅ 4 + 9 ⋅ 3 + 5 ⋅ 2 = 0 + 21 + 42 + 40 + 20 + 27 + 10 = 160 The modulus 11 of this sum is calculated. For calculations, an upper case X in the check digit position indicates a check digit of 10. To confirm the check digit, calculate the sum of all eight digits of the ISSN multiplied by its position in the number, counting from the right. \n  The modulus 11 of the sum must be 0. There is an online ISSN checker. ISSN codes are assigned by a network of ISSN National Centres located at national libraries and coordinated by the ISSN International Centre based in Paris; the International Centre is an intergovernmental organization created in 1974 through an agreement between UNESCO and the French government. The International Centre maintains a database of all ISSNs assigned worldwide, the ISDS Register otherwise known as the ISSN Register. At the end of 2016, the ISSN Register contained records for 1,943,572 items. ISSN and ISBN codes are similar in concept. An ISBN might be assigned for particular issues of a serial, in addition to the ISSN code for the serial as a whole. An ISSN, unlike the ISBN code, is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title, containing no information as to the publisher or its location. For this reason a new ISSN is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title change. Since the ISSN applies to an entire serial a new identifier, the Serial Item and Contribution Identifier, was built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes, articles, or other identifiable components. \n  Separate ISSNs are needed for serials in different media. Thus, the print and electronic media versions of a serial need separate ISSNs. A CD-ROM version and a web version of a serial require different ISSNs since two different media are involved. However, the same ISSN can be used for different file formats of the same online serial; this \"media-oriented identification\" of serials made sense in the 1970s. In the 1990s and onward, with personal computers, better screens, the Web, it makes sense to consider only content, independent of media; this \"content-oriented identification\" of serials was a repressed demand during a decade, but no ISSN update or initiative occurred. A natural extension for ISSN, the unique-identification of the articles in the serials, was the main demand application. An alternative serials' contents model arrived with the indecs Content Model and its application, the digital object identifier, as ISSN-independent initiative, consolidated in the 2000s. Only in 2007, ISSN-L was defined in the \n\n\n\nPattern\n\n\n\n\n\n A pattern is a regularity in the world, man-made design, or abstract ideas. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and repeated like a wallpaper design. Any of the senses may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in science, mathematics, or language may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual patterns in nature are chaotic, never repeating, involve fractals. Natural patterns include spirals, waves, tilings and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection. Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure. In the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world. In art and architecture, decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. In computer science, a software design pattern is a known solution to a class of problems in programming. \n  In fashion, the pattern is a template used to create any number of similar garments. Nature provides examples of many kinds of pattern, including symmetries and other structures with a fractal dimension, meanders, foams, tilings and stripes. Symmetry is widespread in living things. Animals that move have bilateral or mirror symmetry as this favours movement. Plants have radial or rotational symmetry, as do many flowers, as well as animals which are static as adults, such as sea anemones. Fivefold symmetry is found in the echinoderms, including starfish, sea urchins, sea lilies. Among non-living things, snowflakes have striking sixfold symmetry: each flake is unique, its structure recording the varying conditions during its crystallisation on each of its six arms. Crystals have a specific set of possible crystal symmetries. Spiral patterns are found in the body plans of animals including molluscs such as the nautilus, in the phyllotaxis of many plants, both of leaves spiralling around stems, in the multiple spirals found in flowerheads such as the sunflower and fruit structures like the pineapple. \n  Chaos theory predicts that while the laws of physics are deterministic and patterns in nature never repeat because small differences in starting conditions can lead to differing outcomes. Many natural patterns are shaped by this apparent randomness, including vortex streets and other effects of turbulent flow such as meanders in rivers. Waves are disturbances. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium -- water, making it oscillate as they pass by. Wind waves are surface waves; as they pass over sand, such waves create patterns of ripples. Foams obey Plateau's laws, which require films to be smooth and continuous, to have a constant average curvature. Foam and bubble patterns occur in nature, for example in radiolarians, sponge spicules, the skeletons of silicoflagellates and sea urchins. Cracks form in materials to relieve stress: with 120 degree joints in elastic materials, but at 90 degrees in inelastic materials, thus the pattern of cracks indicates. Cracking patterns are widespread in nature, for example in rocks, tree bark and the glazes of old paintings and ceramics. \n  Alan Turing, the mathematical biologist James D. Murray and other scientists, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns, for example in the skin of mammals or the plumage of birds: a reaction-diffusion system involving two counter-acting chemical mechanisms, one that activates and one that inhibits a development, such as of dark pigment in the skin; these spatiotemporal patterns drift, the animals' appearance changing imperceptibly as Turing predicted. In visual art, pattern consists in regularity which in some way \"organizes surfaces or structures in a consistent, regular manner.\" At its simplest, a pattern in art may be a geometric or other repeating shape in a painting, tapestry, ceramic tiling or carpet, but a pattern need not repeat as long as it provides some form or organizing \"skeleton\" in the artwork. In mathematics, a tessellation is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes, with no overlaps and no gaps. In architecture, motifs are repeated in various ways to form patterns. \n  Most structures such as windows can be repeated horizontally and vertically. Architects can use and repeat decorative and structural elements such as columns and lintels. Repetitions need not be identical. Mathematics is sometimes called the \"Science of Pattern\", in the sense of rules that can be applied wherever needed. For example, any sequence of numbers that may be modeled by a mathematical function can be considered a pattern. Mathematics can be taught as a collection of patterns; some mathematical rule-patterns can be visualised, among these are those that explain patterns in nature including the mathematics of symmetry, waves and fractals. Fractals are mathematical patterns; this means that the shape of the pattern does not depend on how close \n\n\n\nKolmogorov complexity\n\n\n\n\n\n In algorithmic information theory, the Kolmogorov complexity of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of the shortest computer program that produces the object as output. It is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object, is known as descriptive complexity, Kolmogorov–Chaitin complexity, algorithmic complexity, algorithmic entropy, or program-size complexity, it is named after Andrey Kolmogorov, who first published on the subject in 1963. The notion of Kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and prove impossibility results akin to Cantor's diagonal argument, Gödel's incompleteness theorem, Turing's halting problem. In particular, for all objects, it is not possible to compute a lower bound for its Kolmogorov complexity, let alone its exact value. Consider the following two strings of 32 lowercase letters and digits. Example 1: abababababababababababababababab Example 2: 4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7The first string has a short English-language description, namely \"ab 16 times\", which consists of 11 characters. \n  The second one has no obvious simple description other than writing down the string itself, which has 32 characters. More formally, the complexity of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string in some fixed universal description language, it can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself. Strings like the abab example above, whose Kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the string's size, are not considered to be complex; the Kolmogorov complexity can be defined for any mathematical object, but for simplicity the scope of this article is restricted to strings. We must first specify a description language for strings; such a description language can be based on any computer programming language, such as Lisp, Pascal, or Java virtual machine bytecode. If P is a program which outputs a string x P is a description of x; the length of the description is just the length of P as a character string, multiplied by the number of bits in a character. \n  We could, choose an encoding for Turing machines, where an encoding is a function which associates to each Turing Machine M a bitstring &lt;M&gt;. If M is a Turing Machine which, on input w, outputs string x the concatenated string &lt;M&gt; w is a description of x. For theoretical analysis, this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is preferred in the research literature. In this article, an informal approach is discussed. Any string s has at least one description. For example, the second string above is output by the program: function GenerateExample2String return \"4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7\" where the first string is output by the pseudo-code: function GenerateExample1String return \"ab\" * 16 If a description d of a string s is of minimal length, it is called a minimal description of s. Thus, the length of d is the Kolmogorov complexity of s, written K. Symbolically, K = |d|; the length of the shortest description will depend on the choice of description language. There are some description languages which are optimal, in the following sense: given any description of an object in a description language, said description may be used in the optimal description language with a constant overhead. \n  The constant depends only on the languages involved, not on the description of the object, nor the object being described. Here is an example of an optimal description language. A description will have two parts: The first part describes another description language; the second part is a description of the object in that language. In more technical terms, the first part of a description is a computer program, with the second part being the input to that computer program which produces the object as output; the invariance theorem follows: Given any description language L, the optimal description language is at least as efficient as L, with some constant overhead. Proof: Any description D in L can be converted into a description in the optimal language by first describing L as a computer program P, using the original description D as input to that program; the total length of this new description D′ is: |D′| = |P| + |D|The length of P is a constant that doesn't depend on D. So, there is at most a constant overhead, regardless of the object described. \n  Therefore, the optimal language is universal up to this additive constant. Theorem: If K1 and K2 are the complexity functions relative to Turing complete description languages L1 and L2 there is a constant c – which depends only on the languages L1 and L2 chosen – such that ∀s. −c ≤ K1 − K2 ≤ c. Proof: By symmetry, it suffices to prove that there is some constant c such that for all strings s K1 ≤ K2 + c. Now, suppose there is a program in the language L1 which acts as an interpreter for L2: function InterpretLanguage where p is a program in L2; the interpreter is characterized by the following property: Running InterpretLanguage on input p returns the result of running p. Thus, if P is a program in L2, a minimal description of s InterpretLanguage returns the string s; the length of this description of s is the sum of The length of the program InterpretLanguage, which we can take to be the constant c. The length of P which \n\n\n\nParse tree\n\n\n\n\n\n A parse tree or parsing tree or derivation tree or concrete syntax tree is an ordered, rooted tree that represents the syntactic structure of a string according to some context-free grammar. The term parse tree itself is used in computational linguistics. Parse trees concretely reflect the syntax of the input language, making them distinct from the abstract syntax trees used in computer programming. Unlike Reed-Kellogg sentence diagrams used for teaching grammar, parse trees do not use distinct symbol shapes for different types of constituents. Parse trees are constructed based on either the constituency relation of constituency grammars or the dependency relation of dependency grammars. Parse trees may be generated for sentences in natural languages, as well as during processing of computer languages, such as programming languages. A related concept is that of phrase marker or P-marker, as used in transformational generative grammar. A phrase marker is a linguistic expression marked as to its phrase structure. \n  This may be presented as a bracketed expression. Phrase markers are generated by applying phrase structure rules, themselves are subject to further transformational rules. A set of possible parse trees for a syntactically ambiguous sentence is called a \"parse forest.\" The constituency-based parse trees of constituency grammars distinguish between terminal and non-terminal nodes. The interior nodes are labeled by non-terminal categories of the grammar, while the leaf nodes are labeled by terminal categories; the image below represents a constituency-based parse tree. The following abbreviations are used in the tree: S for sentence, the top-level structure in this exampleNP for noun phrase; the first NP, a single noun \"John\", serves as the subject of the sentence. The second one is the object of the sentence. VP for verb phrase, which serves as the predicateV for verb. In this case, it's a transitive verb hit. D for determiner, in this instance the definite article \"the\"N for nounEach node in the tree is either a root node, a branch node, or a leaf node. \n  A root node is a node. Within a sentence, there is only one root node. A branch node is a mother node. A leaf node, however, is a terminal node. S is the root node, NP and VP are branch nodes, John, hit and ball are all leaf nodes; the leaves are the lexical tokens of the sentence. A mother node is one. In the example, S is a parent of both N and VP. A daughter node is one that has at least one node directly above it to which it is linked by a branch of a tree. From the example, hit is a daughter node of V; the terms parent and child are sometimes used for this relationship. The dependency-based parse trees of dependency grammars see all nodes as terminal, which means they do not acknowledge the distinction between terminal and non-terminal categories, they are simpler on average than constituency-based parse trees. The dependency-based parse tree for the example sentence above is as follows: This parse tree lacks the phrasal categories seen in the constituency-based counterpart above. Like the constituency-based tree, constituent structure is acknowledged. \n  Any complete sub-tree of the tree is a constituent. Thus this dependency-based parse tree acknowledges the subject noun John and the object noun phrase the ball as constituents just like the constituency-based parse tree does; the constituency vs. dependency distinction is far-reaching. Whether the additional syntactic structure associated with constituency-based parse trees is necessary or beneficial is a matter of debate. Phrase markers, or P-markers, were introduced in early transformational generative grammar, as developed by Noam Chomsky and others. A phrase marker representing the deep structure of a sentence is generated by applying phrase structure rules; this application may undergo further transformations. Phrase markers may be presented in the form of trees, but are given instead in the form of \"bracketed expressions\", which occupy less space in the memory. For example, a bracketed expression corresponding to the constituency-based tree given above may be something like: As with trees, the precise construction of such expressions and the amount of detail shown can depend on the theory being applied and on the points that the query author wishes to illustrate. \n  Syntax Tree Editor Linguistic Tree Constructor phpSyntaxTree – Online parse tree drawing site phpSyntaxTree – Online parse tree drawing site rSyntaxTree Enhanced version of phpSyntaxTree in Ruby with Unicode and Vectorized graphics Qtree – LaTeX package for draw \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Images\n\n\n\n\nFrom this Article\n\n\n\n\nYouTube Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPattern [videos]\n\nA pattern is a regularity in the world, man-made design, or abstract ideas.

Numerous methods have been proposed to tackle this task, of which some have been adapted to external plagiarism detection. Checking a suspicious document in this setting requires the computation and storage of efficiently comparable representations for all documents in the reference collection to compare them pairwise. Generally, suffix document models, such as <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Suffix_tree\" title=\"Suffix tree\" target=\"_blank\">suffix trees</a> or suffix vectors, have been used for this task.

Since most programming assignments expect students to write programs with very specific requirements, it is very difficult to find existing programs that already meet them. Since integrating external code is often harder than writing it from scratch, most plagiarizing students choose to do so from their peers.\n</p>\n<p>According to Roy and Cordy,<sup id=\"cite_ref-40\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Plagiarism_detection#cite_note-40\" target=\"_blank\">[40]</a></sup> source-code similarity detection algorithms can be classified as based on either\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>Strings – look for exact textual matches of segments, for instance five-word runs. Fast, but can be confused by renaming identifiers.</li>\n\n<li>Tokens – as with strings, but using a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Lexical_analysis\" title=\"Lexical analysis\" target=\"_blank\">lexer</a> to convert the program into <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Token_(parser)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Token (parser)\" target=\"_blank\">tokens</a> first. This discards whitespace, comments, and identifier names, making the system more robust to simple text replacements. Most academic plagiarism detection systems work at this level, using different algorithms to measure the similarity between token sequences.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Parse_tree\" title=\"Parse tree\" target=\"_blank\">Parse Trees</a> – build and compare parse trees. This allows higher-level similarities to be detected. For instance, tree comparison can normalize conditional statements, and detect equivalent constructs as similar to each other.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Call_graph\" title=\"Call graph\" target=\"_blank\">Program Dependency Graphs</a> (PDGs) – a PDG captures the actual flow of control in a program, and allows much higher-level equivalences to be located, at a greater expense in complexity and calculation time.</li>\n\n<li>Metrics – metrics capture 'scores' of code segments according to certain criteria; for instance, \"the number of loops and conditionals\", or \"the number of different variables used\". Metrics are simple to calculate and can be compared quickly, but can also lead to false positives: two fragments with the same scores on a set of metrics may do entirely different things.</li>\n\n<li>Hybrid approaches – for instance, parse trees + <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Suffix_tree\" title=\"Suffix tree\" target=\"_blank\">suffix trees</a> can combine the detection capability of parse trees with the speed afforded by suffix trees, a type of string-matching data structure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The previous classification was developed for <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Code_refactoring\" title=\"Code refactoring\" target=\"_blank\">code refactoring</a>, and not for academic plagiarism detection (an important goal of refactoring is to avoid duplicate code, referred to as <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Code_clone\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Code clone\" target=\"_blank\">code clones</a> in the literature); the above approaches are effective against different levels of similarity; low-level similarity refers to identical text, while high-level similarity can be due to similar specifications. In an academic setting, when all students are expected to code to the same specifications, functionally equivalent code (with high-level similarity) is entirely expected, and only low-level similarity is considered as proof of cheating.\n</p>\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Complications_with_the_use_of_text-matching_software_for_plagiarism_detection\">Complications with the use of text-matching software for plagiarism detection</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/w/index.php?title=Plagiarism_detection&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Complications with the use of text-matching software for plagiarism detection\" target=\"_blank\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Various complications have been documented with the use of text-matching software when used for plagiarism detection.

Plagiarism is considered a breach of journalistic ethics, it is subject to sanctions such as penalties and expulsion from school or work. Cases of \"extreme plagiarism\" have been identified in academia; the modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Europe\" target=\"_blank\">Europe</a> in the 18th century with the Romantic movement. Plagiarism is not in itself a crime. In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense. Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not equivalent concepts, many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement, defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts. Plagiarism is not punished by law, but rather by institutions. In the 1st century, the use of the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Latin\" target=\"_blank\">Latin</a> word plagiarius to denote stealing someone else's work was pioneered by the Roman poet Martial, who complained that another poet had \"kidnapped his verses\". </p>\n <p> Plagiary, a derivative of plagiarus, was introduced into English in 1601 by <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Playwright\" target=\"_blank\">dramatist</a> <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Ben_Jonson\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Jonson</a> during the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Jacobean_era\" target=\"_blank\">Jacobean Era</a> to describe someone guilty of literary theft. The derived form plagiarism was introduced into English around 1620; the Latin plagiārius, \"kidnapper\", <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Child_abduction\" target=\"_blank\">plagium</a>, \"kidnapping\", have the root plaga, based on the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Indo-European_languages\" target=\"_blank\">Indo-European</a> root *-plak, \"to weave\". Although plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing, the concept does not exist in a legal sense, although the use of someone else's work in order to gain academic credit may meet some legal definitions of fraud. \"Plagiarism\" is not mentioned in any current statute, either criminal or civil. Some cases may be treated as a violation of the doctrine of moral rights; the increased availability of copyrighted material due to the development of information technology has furthered the debate as to whether copyright offences are criminal. In short, people are asked to use the guideline, \"if you did not write it yourself, you must give credit\". </p>\n <p> Plagiarism is not the same as copyright infringement. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, false claims of authorship constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic credit, achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience. Plagiarism is considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is supposed to be original content. In such cases, acts of plagiarism may sometimes form part of a claim for breach of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a civil wrong. Within academia, plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered academic dishonesty or academic fraud, offenders are subject to academic <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Censure\" target=\"_blank\">censure</a>, up to and including expulsion. </p>\n <p> Some institutions use plagiarism detection software to uncover potential plagiarism and to deter students from plagiarizing. Some universities address the issue of academic integrity by providing students with thorough orientations, required writing courses, articulated honor codes. Indeed, there is a uniform understanding among college students that plagiarism is wrong; each year students are brought before their institutions’ disciplinary boards on charges that they have misused sources in their schoolwork.\" However, the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, known as <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Rogeting\" target=\"_blank\">rogeting</a>, has evolved as students and unethical academics seek to stay ahead of detection software. An extreme form of <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Plagiarism\" target=\"_blank\">plagiarism</a>, known as <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Contract_cheating\" target=\"_blank\">contract cheating</a> involves students paying someone else, such as an <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Essay_mill\" target=\"_blank\">essay mill</a>, to do their work for them. In journalism, plagiarism is considered a breach of journalistic ethics, reporters caught plagiarizing face disciplinary measures ranging from suspension to termination of employment. </p>\n <p> Some individuals caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they plagiarized unintentionally, by failing to include quotations or give the appropriate citation. While plagiarism in scholarship and journalism has a centuries-old history, the development of the Internet, where articles appear as electronic text, has made the physical act of copying the work of others much easier. Predicated upon an expected level of learning/comprehension having been achieved, all associated academic accreditation becomes undermined if plagiarism is allowed to become the norm within academic submissions. For professors and researchers, plagiarism is punished by sanctions ranging from suspension to termination, along with the loss of credibility and perceived integrity. Charges of plagiarism against students and professors are heard by internal disciplinary committees, by which students and professors have agreed to </p>\n\n\n<p>\n<a class=\"ilist-link\" href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Call_graph\" target=\"_blank\">Call graph</a>\n</p>\n<div class=\"rel-topic-img-wrap\">\n<img alt=\"Call graph - A call graph generated for a simple computer program in Python.\" onerror=\"er1(this);\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/A_Call_Graph_generated_by_pycallgraph.png/330px-A_Call_Graph_generated_by_pycallgraph.png\">\n</div>\n\n<p> A call graph is a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Control_flow_graph\" target=\"_blank\">control flow graph</a>, which represents calling relationships between <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Subroutine\" target=\"_blank\">subroutines</a> in a computer program. Each node represents a procedure and each edge indicates that procedure f calls procedure g. Thus, a cycle in the graph indicates recursive procedure calls. Call graphs can be static. A dynamic call graph is a record of an execution of the program, for example as output by a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Profiler_(TV_series)\" target=\"_blank\">profiler</a>. Thus, a dynamic call graph only describes one run of the program. A static call graph is a call graph intended to represent every possible run of the program; the exact static call graph is an <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Undecidable_problem\" target=\"_blank\">undecidable</a> problem, so static call graph algorithms are overapproximations. That is, every call relationship that occurs is represented in the graph, also some call relationships that would never occur in actual runs of the program. Call graphs can be defined to represent varying degrees of precision. A more precise call graph more approximates the behavior of the real program, at the cost of taking longer to compute and more memory to store. </p>\n <p> The most precise call graph is <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Context-sensitive_user_interface\" target=\"_blank\">context-sensitive</a>, which means that for each procedure, the graph contains a separate node for each call stack that procedure can be activated with. A context-sensitive call graph is called a calling context tree; this can be computed dynamically although it may take up a large amount of memory. Calling context trees are not computed statically, because it would take too long for a large program; the least precise call graph is context-insensitive, which means that there is only one node for each procedure. With languages that feature <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch\" target=\"_blank\">dynamic dispatch</a>, such as <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Java\" target=\"_blank\">Java</a> and C++, computing a static call graph requires <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Alias_analysis\" target=\"_blank\">alias analysis</a> results. Conversely, computing precise <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Aliasing\" target=\"_blank\">aliasing</a> requires a call graph. Many static analysis systems solve the apparent infinite regress by computing both simultaneously. Call graphs can be used in different ways. One simple application of call graphs is finding procedures. Call graphs can act as documentation for humans to understand programs. </p>\n <p> They can serve as basis for further analyses, such as an analysis that tracks the flow of values between procedures, or change impact prediction. Call graphs can be used to detect anomalies of program execution or code injection attacks.

The ISSN is helpful in distinguishing between serials with the same title. ISSN are used in ordering, interlibrary loans, other practices in connection with serial literature; the ISSN system was first drafted as an <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization\" target=\"_blank\">International Organization for Standardization</a> international standard in 1971 and published as ISO 3297 in 1975. ISO subcommittee <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/TC_46%2FSC_9\" target=\"_blank\">TC 46/SC 9</a> is responsible for maintaining the standard; when a serial with the same content is published in more than one media type, a different ISSN is assigned to each media type. For example, many serials are published both in electronic media; the ISSN system refers to these types as electronic ISSN, respectively. Conversely, as defined in ISO 3297:2007, every serial in the ISSN system is assigned a linking ISSN the same as the ISSN assigned to the serial in its first published medium, which links together all ISSNs assigned to the serial in every medium. </p>\n <p> The format of the ISSN is an eight digit code, divided by a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Hyphen\" target=\"_blank\">hyphen</a> into two four-digit numbers. As an <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Integer\" target=\"_blank\">integer</a> number, it can be represented by the first seven digits; the last code digit, which may be 0-9 or an X, is a check digit. Formally, the general form of the ISSN code can be expressed as follows: NNNN-NNNC where N is in the set, a digit character, C is in; the ISSN of the journal Hearing Research, for example, is 0378-5955, where the final 5 is the check digit, C=5. To calculate the check digit, the following algorithm may be used: Calculate the sum of the first seven digits of the ISSN multiplied by its position in the number, counting from the right—that is, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, respectively: 0 ⋅ 8 + 3 ⋅ 7 + 7 ⋅ 6 + 8 ⋅ 5 + 5 ⋅ 4 + 9 ⋅ 3 + 5 ⋅ 2 = 0 + 21 + 42 + 40 + 20 + 27 + 10 = 160 The modulus 11 of this sum is calculated. For calculations, an upper case X in the check digit position indicates a check digit of 10. To confirm the check digit, calculate the sum of all eight digits of the ISSN multiplied by its position in the number, counting from the right. </p>\n <p> The modulus 11 of the sum must be 0. There is an online ISSN checker. ISSN codes are assigned by a network of ISSN National Centres located at national libraries and coordinated by the ISSN International Centre based in <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Paris\" target=\"_blank\">Paris</a>; the International Centre is an intergovernmental organization created in 1974 through an agreement between <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/UNESCO\" target=\"_blank\">UNESCO</a> and the French government. The International Centre maintains a database of all ISSNs assigned worldwide, the ISDS Register otherwise known as the ISSN Register. At the end of 2016, the ISSN Register contained records for 1,943,572 items. ISSN and ISBN codes are similar in concept. An ISBN might be assigned for particular issues of a serial, in addition to the ISSN code for the serial as a whole. An ISSN, unlike the ISBN code, is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title, containing no information as to the publisher or its location. For this reason a new ISSN is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title change. Since the ISSN applies to an entire serial a new identifier, the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Serial_Item_and_Contribution_Identifier\" target=\"_blank\">Serial Item and Contribution Identifier</a>, was built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes, articles, or other identifiable components. </p>\n <p> Separate ISSNs are needed for serials in different media. Thus, the print and electronic media versions of a serial need separate ISSNs. A <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/CD-ROM\" target=\"_blank\">CD-ROM</a> version and a web version of a serial require different ISSNs since two different media are involved. However, the same ISSN can be used for different file formats of the same online serial; this \"media-oriented identification\" of serials made sense in the 1970s. In the 1990s and onward, with personal computers, better screens, the Web, it makes sense to consider only content, independent of media; this \"content-oriented identification\" of serials was a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Shortage\" target=\"_blank\">repressed demand</a> during a decade, but no ISSN update or initiative occurred. A natural extension for ISSN, the unique-identification of the articles in the serials, was the main demand application. An alternative serials' contents model arrived with the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Indecs_Content_Model\" target=\"_blank\">indecs Content Model</a> and its application, the digital object identifier, as ISSN-independent initiative, consolidated in the 2000s.

As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and repeated like a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Wallpaper\" target=\"_blank\">wallpaper</a> design. Any of the senses may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in science, <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Mathematics\" target=\"_blank\">mathematics</a>, or language may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual patterns in nature are chaotic, never repeating, involve <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Fractal\" target=\"_blank\">fractals</a>. Natural patterns include spirals, waves, tilings and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection. Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure. In the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world. In art and architecture, decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. In computer science, a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Software_design_pattern\" target=\"_blank\">software design pattern</a> is a known solution to a class of problems in programming. </p>\n <p> In fashion, the pattern is a template used to create any number of similar garments. Nature provides examples of many kinds of pattern, including symmetries and other structures with a fractal dimension, meanders, foams, tilings and stripes. Symmetry is widespread in living things. Animals that move have bilateral or mirror symmetry as this favours movement. Plants have radial or rotational symmetry, as do many flowers, as well as animals which are static as adults, such as sea anemones. Fivefold symmetry is found in the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Echinoderm\" target=\"_blank\">echinoderms</a>, including <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Starfish\" target=\"_blank\">starfish</a>, sea urchins, sea lilies. Among non-living things, snowflakes have striking <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Dihedral_group\" target=\"_blank\">sixfold symmetry</a>: each flake is unique, its structure recording the varying conditions during its <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Crystallization\" target=\"_blank\">crystallisation</a> on each of its six arms. Crystals have a specific set of possible crystal symmetries. Spiral patterns are found in the body plans of animals including <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Mollusca\" target=\"_blank\">molluscs</a> such as the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Nautilus\" target=\"_blank\">nautilus</a>, in the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Phyllotaxis\" target=\"_blank\">phyllotaxis</a> of many plants, both of leaves spiralling around stems, in the multiple spirals found in flowerheads such as the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Sunflower\" target=\"_blank\">sunflower</a> and fruit structures like the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Pineapple\" target=\"_blank\">pineapple</a>. </p>\n <p> Chaos theory predicts that while the laws of <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Physics\" target=\"_blank\">physics</a> are <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Determinism\" target=\"_blank\">deterministic</a> and patterns in nature never repeat because small differences in starting conditions can lead to differing outcomes. Many natural patterns are shaped by this apparent randomness, including vortex streets and other effects of turbulent flow such as meanders in rivers. Waves are disturbances. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium -- water, making it <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Oscillation\" target=\"_blank\">oscillate</a> as they pass by. Wind waves are surface waves; as they pass over sand, such waves create patterns of ripples. Foams obey Plateau's laws, which require films to be smooth and continuous, to have a constant average curvature. Foam and bubble patterns occur in nature, for example in <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Radiolaria\" target=\"_blank\">radiolarians</a>, <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Sponge\" target=\"_blank\">sponge</a> <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Sponge_spicule\" target=\"_blank\">spicules</a>, the skeletons of silicoflagellates and sea urchins. Cracks form in materials to relieve stress: with 120 degree joints in elastic materials, but at 90 degrees in inelastic materials, thus the pattern of cracks indicates. Cracking patterns are widespread in nature, for example in rocks, tree bark and the glazes of old paintings and ceramics. </p>\n <p> <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Alan_Turing\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Turing</a>, the mathematical <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Biologist\" target=\"_blank\">biologist</a> <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/James_D._Murray\" target=\"_blank\">James D. Murray</a> and other scientists, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns, for example in the skin of mammals or the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Plumage\" target=\"_blank\">plumage</a> of birds: a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system\" target=\"_blank\">reaction-diffusion system</a> involving two counter-acting chemical mechanisms, one that activates and one that inhibits a development, such as of dark <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Pigment\" target=\"_blank\">pigment</a> in the skin; these spatiotemporal patterns drift, the animals' appearance changing imperceptibly as Turing predicted. In visual art, pattern consists in regularity which in some way \"organizes surfaces or structures in a consistent, regular manner.\" At its simplest, a pattern in art may be a geometric or other repeating shape in a painting, <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Tapestry\" target=\"_blank\">tapestry</a>, <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Ceramic\" target=\"_blank\">ceramic</a> tiling or carpet, but a pattern need not repeat as long as it provides some form or organizing \"skeleton\" in the artwork. In mathematics, a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Tessellation\" target=\"_blank\">tessellation</a> is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes, with no overlaps and no gaps. In architecture, motifs are repeated in various ways to form patterns. </p>\n <p> Most structures such as windows can be repeated horizontally and vertically. Architects can use and repeat decorative and structural elements such as columns and <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Lintel\" target=\"_blank\">lintels</a>. Repetitions need not be identical. <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Mathematics\" target=\"_blank\">Mathematics</a> is sometimes called the \"Science of Pattern\", in the sense of rules that can be applied wherever needed. For example, any sequence of numbers that may be modeled by a mathematical function can be considered a pattern. Mathematics can be taught as a collection of patterns; some mathematical rule-patterns can be visualised, among these are those that explain patterns in nature including the mathematics of symmetry, waves and <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Fractal\" target=\"_blank\">fractals</a>.

It is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object, is known as descriptive complexity, Kolmogorov–Chaitin complexity, algorithmic complexity, algorithmic <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Entropy\" target=\"_blank\">entropy</a>, or program-size complexity, it is named after <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov\" target=\"_blank\">Andrey Kolmogorov</a>, who first published on the subject in 1963. The notion of Kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and prove impossibility results akin to Cantor's diagonal argument, <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems\" target=\"_blank\">Gödel's incompleteness theorem</a>, Turing's <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Halting_problem\" target=\"_blank\">halting problem</a>. In particular, for all objects, it is not possible to compute a lower bound for its Kolmogorov complexity, let alone its exact value. Consider the following two strings of 32 lowercase letters and digits. Example 1: abababababababababababababababab Example 2: 4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7The first string has a short English-language description, namely \"ab 16 times\", which consists of 11 characters. </p>\n <p> The second one has no obvious simple description other than writing down the string itself, which has 32 characters. More formally, the complexity of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string in some fixed universal description language, it can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself. Strings like the abab example above, whose Kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the string's size, are not considered to be complex; the Kolmogorov complexity can be defined for any mathematical object, but for simplicity the scope of this article is restricted to strings. We must first specify a description language for strings; such a description language can be based on any computer programming language, such as <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\">Lisp</a>, Pascal, or <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Java_virtual_machine\" target=\"_blank\">Java virtual machine</a> <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Bytecode\" target=\"_blank\">bytecode</a>. If P is a program which outputs a string x P is a description of x; the length of the description is just the length of P as a character string, multiplied by the number of bits in a character. </p>\n <p> We could, choose an encoding for Turing machines, where an encoding is a function which associates to each <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Turing_machine\" target=\"_blank\">Turing Machine</a> M a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Bit_array\" target=\"_blank\">bitstring</a> &lt;M&gt;. If M is a Turing Machine which, on input w, outputs string x the concatenated string &lt;M&gt; w is a description of x. For theoretical analysis, this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is preferred in the research literature. In this article, an informal approach is discussed. Any string s has at least one description. For example, the second string above is output by the program: function GenerateExample2String return \"4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7\" where the first string is output by the <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Pseudocode\" target=\"_blank\">pseudo-code</a>: function GenerateExample1String return \"ab\" * 16 If a description d of a string s is of minimal length, it is called a minimal description of s. Thus, the length of d is the Kolmogorov complexity of s, written K. Symbolically, K = |d|; the length of the shortest description will depend on the choice of description language. There are some description languages which are optimal, in the following sense: given any description of an object in a description language, said description may be used in the optimal description language with a constant overhead. </p>\n <p> The constant depends only on the languages involved, not on the description of the object, nor the object being described. Here is an example of an optimal description language. A description will have two parts: The first part describes another description language; the second part is a description of the object in that language. In more technical terms, the first part of a description is a computer program, with the second part being the input to that computer program which produces the object as output; the invariance theorem follows: Given any description language L, the optimal description language is at least as efficient as L, with some constant overhead. Proof: Any description D in L can be converted into a description in the optimal language by first describing L as a computer program P, using the original description D as input to that program; the total length of this new description D′ is: |D′| = |P| + |D|The length of P is a constant that doesn't depend on D. So, there is at most a constant overhead, regardless of the object described. </p>\n <p> Therefore, the optimal language is universal up to this additive constant. Theorem: If K1 and K2 are the complexity functions relative to <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Turing_completeness\" target=\"_blank\">Turing complete</a> description languages L1 and L2 there is a constant c – which depends only on the languages L1 and L2 chosen – such that ∀s. −c ≤ K1 − K2 ≤ c. Proof: By symmetry, it suffices to prove that there is some constant c such that for all strings s K1 ≤ K2 + c. Now, suppose there is a program in the language L1 which acts as an interpreter for L2: function InterpretLanguage where p is a program in L2; the interpreter is characterized by the following property: Running InterpretLanguage on input p returns the result of running p. Thus, if P is a program in L2, a minimal description of s InterpretLanguage returns the string s; the length of this description of s is the sum of The length of the program InterpretLanguage, which we can take to be the constant c.

The term parse tree itself is used in computational <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Linguistics\" target=\"_blank\">linguistics</a>. Parse trees concretely reflect the syntax of the input language, making them distinct from the abstract syntax trees used in computer programming. Unlike Reed-Kellogg sentence diagrams used for teaching grammar, parse trees do not use distinct symbol shapes for different types of constituents. Parse trees are constructed based on either the constituency relation of constituency grammars or the dependency relation of dependency grammars. Parse trees may be generated for sentences in natural languages, as well as during processing of computer languages, such as programming languages. A related concept is that of phrase marker or P-marker, as used in <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Transformational_grammar\" target=\"_blank\">transformational generative grammar</a>. A phrase marker is a linguistic expression marked as to its phrase structure. </p>\n <p> This may be presented as a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Bracket_(architecture)\" target=\"_blank\">bracketed</a> expression. Phrase markers are generated by applying phrase structure rules, themselves are subject to further transformational rules. A set of possible parse trees for a syntactically ambiguous sentence is called a \"parse forest.\" The constituency-based parse trees of constituency grammars distinguish between terminal and non-terminal nodes. The interior nodes are labeled by non-terminal categories of the grammar, while the leaf nodes are labeled by terminal categories; the image below represents a constituency-based parse tree. The following abbreviations are used in the tree: S for sentence, the top-level structure in this exampleNP for noun phrase; the first NP, a single noun \"John\", serves as the subject of the sentence. The second one is the object of the sentence. VP for verb phrase, which serves as the predicateV for verb. In this case, it's a <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Transitive_relation\" target=\"_blank\">transitive</a> verb hit. D for <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Determiner\" target=\"_blank\">determiner</a>, in this instance the definite article \"the\"N for nounEach node in the tree is either a root node, a branch node, or a leaf node. </p>\n <p> A root node is a node. Within a sentence, there is only one root node. A branch node is a mother node. A leaf node, however, is a terminal node. S is the root node, NP and VP are branch nodes, John, hit and ball are all leaf nodes; the leaves are the lexical tokens of the sentence. A mother node is one. In the example, S is a parent of both N and VP. A daughter node is one that has at least one node directly above it to which it is linked by a branch of a tree. From the example, hit is a daughter node of V; the terms parent and child are sometimes used for this relationship. The dependency-based parse trees of dependency grammars see all nodes as terminal, which means they do not acknowledge the distinction between terminal and non-terminal categories, they are simpler on average than constituency-based parse trees. The dependency-based parse tree for the example sentence above is as follows: This parse tree lacks the phrasal categories seen in the constituency-based counterpart above. Like the constituency-based tree, constituent structure is acknowledged. </p>\n <p> Any complete sub-tree of the tree is a constituent. Thus this dependency-based parse tree acknowledges the subject noun John and the object noun phrase the ball as constituents just like the constituency-based parse tree does; the constituency vs. dependency distinction is far-reaching. Whether the additional syntactic structure associated with constituency-based parse trees is necessary or beneficial is a matter of debate. Phrase markers, or P-markers, were introduced in early transformational generative grammar, as developed by <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Noam_Chomsky\" target=\"_blank\">Noam Chomsky</a> and others. A phrase marker representing the deep structure of a sentence is generated by applying phrase structure rules; this application may undergo further transformations. Phrase markers may be presented in the form of trees, but are given instead in the form of \"bracketed expressions\", which occupy less space in the memory. For example, a bracketed expression corresponding to the constituency-based tree given above may be something like: As with trees, the precise construction of such expressions and the amount of detail shown can depend on the theory being applied and on the points that the query author wishes to illustrate. </p>\n <p> <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree\" target=\"_blank\">Syntax Tree</a> Editor Linguistic Tree Constructor phpSyntaxTree – Online parse tree drawing site phpSyntaxTree – Online parse tree drawing site rSyntaxTree Enhanced version of phpSyntaxTree in Ruby with <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Unicode\" target=\"_blank\">Unicode</a> and <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Array_programming\" target=\"_blank\">Vectorized</a> graphics Qtree – <a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Latex\" target=\"_blank\">LaTeX</a> package for draw </p>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-6 vid-img-col\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 sec-title-col\">\n<div class=\"section-title related-sec-title rel-title-border\" id=\"section_related\">\nRelated Images\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section-title from-art-link\">\n<a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Plagiarism_detection#section_from_article\" target=\"_blank\">\nFrom this Article\n</a>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section-title yt-desk-sec-title hidden-xs hidden-sm\">\n<a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/video/Plagiarism_detection\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Videos</a>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"row rel-and-vid-block\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-8 imgs-col\">\n<fieldset class=\"fs1\">\n<legend><a href=\"https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Pattern\" target=\"_blank\">Pattern</a> <a class=\"ov1 ni1\" href=\"https://wikivisually.com/video/Pattern\" target=\"_blank\">[videos]</a></legend>\n<div class=\"ts1\">\nA pattern is a regularity in the world, man-made design, or abstract ideas.
